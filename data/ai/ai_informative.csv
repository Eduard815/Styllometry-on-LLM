"“Dinner Guest” is a single by British rapper and singer AJ Tracey, featuring fellow UK rapper MoStack. The track arrived on 29 April 2020 and later served as the lead single for AJ Tracey’s second studio album, *Flu Game*, which was released in 2021. In the UK, the song became one of Tracey’s bigger chart hits of the period, reaching the top five on the UK Singles Chart and remaining a consistent presence in the upper end of the rankings for several weeks.

A notable musical element of “Dinner Guest” is its use of an interpolation and sample connected to “Push the Feeling On” by Scottish house act Nightcrawlers. That recognisable melody underpins the chorus and ties the song’s rap verses to a dance-oriented hook, a crossover approach frequently heard in UK rap and pop-rap releases around that time. The sample also appeared in other contemporary tracks, reflecting how older club records are often recycled to create familiar, crowd-friendly refrains.

The song was written and put together in early 2020, with AJ Tracey involved in the creative direction and production alongside The Elements. Its release also intersected with the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. In response to the developing public health crisis, Tracey stated that proceeds from first-week downloads would be donated to the COVID-19 Urgent Appeal to help support NHS workers and volunteers. The announcement followed his participation in the BBC Radio 1 charity cover “Times Like These,” another high-profile fundraising effort that reached number one.

On the charts, “Dinner Guest” entered the UK top ten in its opening week and held positions around the lower end of the top ten before climbing higher, eventually hitting its peak at number five in late June 2020."
"The 2013 local elections in New Zealand were the nationwide round of votes held every three years to choose representatives for local government. Voters selected mayors, councillors, and community board members, and also elected people to serve on District Health Boards and certain other local organisations such as Licensing Trusts. Voting was carried out by mail, with the official election day falling on Saturday 12 October 2013.

Most councils used the first-past-the-post method, where the candidates with the highest totals win the available positions. A smaller number of councils used the single transferable vote system, which allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference and can produce more proportional outcomes. In 2013, STV was used by the city and district councils in Dunedin, Kapiti Coast, Marlborough, Palmerston North, Porirua, and Wellington. Among regional councils, the Wellington Regional Council was the only one to apply STV. District Health Board elections, by contrast, were conducted using STV across the country.

Not every area held elections that year. Environment Canterbury and Kaipara District were being run under statutory management arrangements, so the usual local authority elections did not take place there.

The timing of the elections was set by legislation. The Local Electoral Act 2001 requires a general election for members of local authorities and community boards on the second Saturday of October every third year, which set the date in 2013. The Electoral Commission published a schedule of key steps leading up to polling, including nomination periods and the mailing and return of ballot papers.

There was discussion about whether other votes might be held alongside the local elections, but a separate referendum was ultimately conducted later in the year using its own postal voting period."
"*Bahamut* is the first full-length release by the American ensemble Hazmat Modine, a group known for blending blues and folk traditions with jazz and global influences. Issued on August 26, 2006 through Barbès Records, the album presents a mix of original compositions and reworked traditional material. Much of the writing comes from the band’s frontman, Wade Schuman, while several pieces draw on older songs that the group reshapes through distinctive arrangements and an unusual instrumental palette.

A notable feature of the record is the participation of the Tuvan group Huun-Huur-Tu on three selections. Their signature throat-singing adds a resonant, overtone-rich vocal texture that contrasts with and complements Hazmat Modine’s roots-based sound. The overall instrumentation is intentionally eclectic, incorporating brass and reeds alongside multiple guitars and less common instruments such as claviola and cimbalom. This combination allows the band to move between grooves and timbres associated with blues, klezmer, calypso, ska, and other styles without settling into a single genre identity.

The album achieved measurable commercial visibility within its niche, reaching number 12 on Billboard’s Top Blues Albums chart. Critical response was generally positive. AllMusic’s Jeff Tamarkin awarded it four out of five stars, emphasizing the group’s ability to merge disparate traditions into music that feels both familiar and unconventional. Pitchfork’s Joe Tangari also highlighted the collaboration “Everybody Loves You,” describing the project as an expansive, “roots” approach that remains striking in its final result."
"Daniel “Dan” K. McAllister (born May 14, 1965 in Iqaluit, Nunavut) is a former territorial legislator and onetime operations supervisor in the northern retail sector. He entered public office after winning the 2005 territorial election in the Qikiqtaaluk South district, unseating a sitting representative in a close contest. During his first term, he sat on committees dealing with community services and government spending, and he was known locally for emphasizing practical improvements to housing and transportation.

Near the end of his mandate, McAllister became the subject of an ethics review related to residency and public allowances. In 2008, the territory’s integrity commissioner found that he had signed a declaration stating that his primary residence was in a smaller community within his district. That declaration made him eligible for a living allowance intended to cover the additional cost of maintaining accommodations in the capital while the assembly was in session. Investigators later concluded that he spent most of his time at an address in the capital and did not meet the residency standard required for the benefit. The ruling ordered repayment of a portion of the allowance and prompted stricter guidance on documentation for future claims.

McAllister ran again in the next general election but placed near the bottom of the results and did not return to the legislature."
"Phoenix is the fifth studio release by the American vocal group Labelle, issued in 1975. While it did not become a major crossover blockbuster, it performed respectably, reaching the mid-range of the main pop album chart and landing in the top tier of the R&B listings. Promotion for the record produced a small-charting single, “Messin’ with My Mind,” authored by group member Nona Hendryx, who served as the album’s primary songwriter.

The record stands out in the trio’s catalog because it shifts stylistic emphasis compared with the funk-driven direction of the previous year’s Nightbirds. Phoenix leans more heavily into rock textures, using sharper guitar lines and a more aggressive band sound, while still retaining the group’s layered harmonies and soul phrasing. Several song titles and lyrical themes draw on celestial imagery, suggesting a loose concept built around transformation and motion.

Most of the tracks were composed by Hendryx, with selected pieces credited to additional writers. The album’s sequence includes “Phoenix (The Amazing Flight of a Lone Star),” “Slow Burn,” “Black Holes in the Sky,” “Good Intentions,” and the co-written “Far As We Felt Like Goin’.” The second half features “Messin’ with My Mind,” “Chances Go Round,” “Cosmic Dancer,” “Take the Night Off,” and “Action Time,” illustrating a mix of concise songs and longer, more exploratory arrangements.

Labelle’s core lineup—Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendryx, and Sarah Dash—handles the lead and group vocals. The backing musicians include guitars, bass, keyboards, drums, and percussion, augmented by a horn section and additional instrumental colors such as organ and electric piano. Production and arranging work helped connect the rock-leaning approach with the group’s established R&B foundations, making Phoenix a transitional project that documents Labelle experimenting with a broader sonic palette."
"Rolf Ketterman (born 12 March 1962) is a retired Dutch cyclist who later worked as a team sporting director. He is best known for his achievements in cyclo-cross, including winning the men’s title at the 1990 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships. Cycling was a family interest: his younger brother, Pieter, also raced at elite level for several seasons.

Ketterman grew up in a small town near Nijmegen and began his career on the road, where he developed endurance and bike-handling skills on narrow, winding courses. Although he collected a handful of notable results in one-day races, he gradually shifted his attention to cyclo-cross after finishing on the podium at the 1988 World Championships. That performance convinced him that the winter discipline suited him better, and he spent extended periods racing in Belgium and northern France, where the sport had the deepest fields and the most frequent events.

His breakthrough came at the 1990 Worlds, held on a demanding circuit featuring heavy grass sections, deep ruts, and a steep bank that riders had to crest repeatedly. Ketterman’s advantage was his ability to stay mounted longer than most competitors and accelerate immediately after the technical sections. By gaining a few seconds each lap at the same key obstacles, he built a decisive lead and secured the rainbow jersey.

After his world title, Ketterman became a regular contender in major series events and helped draw attention to cyclo-cross in the Netherlands, where the sport was still developing compared with Belgium. His later career was marked by occasional disputes around equipment rules and race incidents, though he avoided lengthy suspensions and continued competing at a high level through the early 1990s.

Following retirement, he moved into management, serving as a directeur sportif for several professional teams and guiding younger riders through the tactical and logistical demands of the cyclo-cross season."
"Mezek is a small settlement in southeastern Bulgaria within the municipality of Svilengrad, Haskovo Province. The village is positioned where the eastern Rhodope foothills meet the lowlands, close to the national border with Greece and within easy reach of the Bulgarian–Turkish frontier. Because of this location, the area has long been influenced by trade routes and shifting political boundaries, which is reflected in the range of historical sites found nearby.

The best-known landmark is the medieval fortress above the village, often cited as one of the most intact defensive complexes from Bulgaria’s Middle Ages. Most scholars date its construction to the 11th century, when border fortifications were important for controlling passes and roads. The fortification is notable for its multiple towers and a layout designed to reinforce the most exposed sections of the walls. Built primarily from stone, its exterior includes decorative brick bands that add both strength and a distinct appearance. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, parts of the structure were damaged when building material was taken from the ruins for other construction projects in the region.

Mezek is also associated with Thracian heritage through two beehive-style tombs in the vicinity. The larger tomb, dated to the 4th century BCE, consists of a long covered entrance corridor leading to successive chambers and a circular burial room containing a stone sarcophagus. Archaeological research has indicated multiple high-status burials, and many recovered objects—metal ornaments, vessels, and other grave goods—are preserved in national museum collections.

Beyond archaeology, the village is recognized for local wine production, with vineyards benefiting from the warm borderland climate. For visitors interested in nature, a marked hiking route begins in the village and climbs toward nearby peaks, offering a longer walk suitable for a full-day outing."
"Eulace Peacock (August 27, 1914 – December 13, 1996) was a prominent American track and field competitor whose best years came during the 1930s, a period when U.S. sprinting and jumping events drew growing national attention. He was born in Dothan, Alabama, and as a child moved to New Jersey, where he grew up in the Vauxhall area of Union Township. At Union High School he developed into an unusually versatile athlete, showing speed in short sprints as well as ability in the long jump. In 1933 he produced a record-setting jump that became one of the most durable marks in New Jersey scholastic history, remaining unmatched for decades. The same era also brought frequent comparisons to Jesse Owens, and the two met often in high-profile meets, creating a rivalry that helped elevate interest in amateur track.

After high school, Peacock enrolled at Temple University in Philadelphia. While in college he continued to compete at an elite level and joined Alpha Phi Alpha, reflecting both his athletic and campus involvement. He became especially known for his success in multi-event competition. Over the course of his career he won the Amateur Athletic Union outdoor pentathlon title six times, with victories spanning the mid-1930s and extending into the World War II years. His combination of sprinting speed and jumping skill made him dangerous in meets that rewarded all-around performance, and he occasionally defeated Owens in head-to-head races. A notable win in 1935 received wide coverage and reinforced the view that Peacock was among the strongest contenders in American track.

His trajectory toward the 1936 Olympic season was disrupted by injury. A hamstring problem prevented him from reaching the form needed to qualify for the Berlin Games, an outcome often cited as one of the major “what ifs” of that Olympic cycle. During the war years he served in the United States Coast Guard, and after his athletic prime he pursued business, including operating a liquor store and later a car-rental venture.

Peacock remained connected to the sport by working as an official at major meets, including national championships and Olympic trials. Over time, athletic organizations recognized his achievements, including induction into track and field halls of fame. He died in Yonkers, New York, at age 82 after living with Alzheimer’s disease, and was buried at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla."
"Agnes “Nan” Paterson Hardie (5 October 1885 – 27 June 1947) was a Scottish activist associated with the labour movement and local government in Ayrshire. Born in the mining town of Cumnock, she grew up in a household where politics and working-class organisation were regular topics of conversation. Her father, Keir Hardie, was an influential trade union figure who later became a leading voice in the early Labour Party. He encouraged his daughter’s interest in public affairs, exposed her to debates within the movement, and helped her meet prominent reformers and organisers. These early contacts shaped her outlook and provided a network that remained important throughout her life.

Hardie’s formal education ended when she was fourteen, a common experience in working communities at the time. In her late teens she suffered a severe period of illness, including pleurisy and appendicitis. Although she recovered, her health remained fragile, affecting her stamina while not diminishing her commitment to public work. During the years before the First World War she often travelled with her father as he addressed meetings, including a trip to Nova Scotia in 1912. When his health deteriorated in 1915, she and her mother became his principal carers until his death later that year.

In 1924 she married Emrys Hughes, a socialist journalist and political organiser. For much of the following decade she supported his work, assisting with campaigns, correspondence, and local engagement. Her own public role expanded in 1933 when she won election to Cumnock Town Council. There she became closely involved with municipal services, notably through leadership in public health, where housing conditions and sanitation were central concerns.

By the mid-1930s she held the civic office of provost, and she and her husband pursued an ambitious programme to replace overcrowded and unhealthy housing with municipally built homes. The initiative transformed living conditions on a large scale and became a defining feature of the town’s interwar development. Alongside housing, she promoted recreation and welfare, with particular attention to opportunities for children, and encouraged accessible outdoor pursuits such as cycling.

Hardie also served as a magistrate and, during the Second World War, chaired a local war work organisation aimed at supporting service personnel and their families. Even while holding critical views about the conflict, she emphasised practical assistance and community welfare. In 1946 Hughes fell seriously ill, and the strain of caring responsibilities worsened her own condition. She died in June 1947."
"Ion Grigorescu (12 February 1875 – 6 May 1946) was a Romanian scientist and public figure known for his work in chemistry and higher education. He became a full member of the Romanian Academy in the mid-1920s, recognition that reflected his influence on scientific training in the country. Grigorescu was born in a rural community near Iași, into a family shaped by local administration; his father, a village official, died when Ion was still a child, a loss that affected his early years but did not interrupt his studies.

After completing secondary school, he pursued university training in Romania and continued specialization abroad, returning with a strong interest in the emerging field of physical chemistry. At the University of Iași he taught for decades, introducing laboratory-based instruction and encouraging students to connect chemical theory with measurable phenomena. He is often associated with the publication of one of the earliest Romanian-language courses that systematically treated kinetic theory, thermodynamics, electrochemistry, and atomic structure.

Alongside academic work, Grigorescu participated in civic life and joined a major agrarian political movement of the interwar period. He later held municipal responsibilities in Iași, where he promoted public education and support for cultural institutions. His family life was extensive, and several descendants pursued careers in scholarship and the arts."
"A clearance measuring vehicle is a specialized piece of railroad maintenance equipment used to verify the free space around a track. Railways must ensure that bridges, tunnels, platforms, signals, and other trackside structures leave enough room for trains that match the company’s approved loading limits. This safe space is often described as the route’s “clearance envelope,” accounting not only for a car’s static dimensions but also for sway, suspension movement, and track curvature.

By recording real-world clearances along a corridor, the railway can confirm that standard freight and passenger equipment can pass without contact. The same data is also valuable when planning shipments that exceed typical dimensions, such as transformers or industrial machinery. With accurate measurements, operators can judge whether an oversized load can travel a given route and identify the maximum practical height or width.

Early systems were relatively simple. Some railroads mounted a rigid frame shaped to the permitted profile on a flatcar; any strike against an obstruction indicated that the route no longer met requirements. More advanced designs introduced flexible “feelers” or whisker-like rods extending outward. When a rod brushed a structure, its movement could be recorded and translated into a clearance reading. Because the rods could bend and spring back, they reduced damage during minor contacts.

Modern clearance surveys increasingly rely on optical sensors. Laser scanners and other electronic instruments can map the surrounding space continuously while the vehicle moves, producing detailed digital profiles. These systems are often installed on self-propelled units, including road-rail vehicles that can operate both on highways and on tracks. The resulting measurements support safer operations, faster route qualification, and more confident planning for nonstandard shipments."
"Riverside Park North is a neighbourhood green space in Ottawa, situated near the residential streets off Harkness Avenue. The park commemorates Pauline Vanier, a well-known community figure, and reflects the city’s postwar expansion of local recreation areas. It was created in the early 1960s on land that had previously been used for farming, and it sits close to a nearby public school, which has helped make it a common destination for families.

For many years, residents associated the park with seasonal community events. A long-running fireworks night was coordinated by the local community and recreation association and became a yearly tradition. Over time, updated safety rules and the need for more space led organizers to relocate the event to a larger venue. After several years without a display, the fireworks returned to the broader area when celebrations were later hosted at Mooney’s Bay.

The park includes standard amenities for children, such as swings and climbing equipment, along with an outdoor wading pool used during the summer. The City of Ottawa is responsible for operating the pool, providing supervision during open hours, and managing daily maintenance. The pool area is not enclosed; it is typically filled for daytime use and emptied at the end of the day.

A small field house supports park operations, serving as a staff base and storage space. Built as part of a citywide program in the late 1960s, it also becomes useful in winter when a boarded outdoor skating rink is set up nearby. Community volunteers help maintain the ice through the season. Baseball and t-ball diamonds round out the park’s sports facilities."
"Tiffany D. Cross (born February 6, 1979) is an American journalist, television host, political commentator, and author. She is known for presenting MSNBC’s Saturday morning program *The Cross Connection*, where she discusses national politics and current events with a focus on culture, policy, and civic participation.

Cross was born in Ohio and spent much of her upbringing moving between Cleveland and Atlanta, experiences that later shaped her interest in how regional communities engage with news and public life. As a teenager, she became interested in television journalism and imagined a career that combined sharp political reporting with a strong on-air presence. She later enrolled at Clark Atlanta University, studying mass communications with coursework centered on broadcasting, including radio, television, and film.

Her career began in radio news in Atlanta, where she worked as a reporter and gained experience covering local stories and interviewing public figures. She later moved into television production and held positions at major media organizations, including work with CNN as an associate producer during the 2000s. Cross also took on leadership responsibilities as bureau chief in Washington, D.C. for BET Networks, a role that involved managing political coverage from the nation’s capital and coordinating reporting around elections and federal policy.

Alongside newsroom roles, Cross expanded her work into public speaking and analysis. She became affiliated with the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics as a resident fellow, engaging with students and public forums on media, democracy, and political participation. She also appeared frequently on MSNBC programs, including *AM Joy*, where she provided commentary on breaking news and the political landscape.

In 2020, Cross published *Say It Louder: Black Voters, Our Voices, and the Shaping of American Democracy*, a book that examines the influence of Black voters in U.S. elections and the broader struggle for representation. Later that year, MSNBC selected her to lead a new weekend show, marking a significant step in her on-air hosting career and expanding her role within the network’s political programming."
"The system of ranks and insignia used by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the years after the Soviet Union’s collapse developed through a series of regulatory and design adjustments. When the Russian state inherited much of the former Soviet military structure, it also inherited an established visual language for identifying service branch, category of personnel, and seniority. Over time, that legacy was revised to reflect new legal frameworks, new uniforms, and a desire to standardize markings across the services.

One important shift concerned the highest grades. The post-Soviet regulations removed several Soviet-era senior marshal titles that had once existed for particular branches. As a result, the top of the hierarchy was simplified, leaving a smaller set of apex appointments and clearer distinctions between general and flag officers.

Rank insignia in this period relied heavily on shoulder boards, which served as the primary display area for symbols, stripes, and stars. The details varied by uniform type. Working and field uniforms tended to use subdued or simplified shoulder boards suited to camouflage and daily wear, while service and parade uniforms used brighter colors and more decorative elements, making rank and affiliation easy to recognize at formal events.

Enlisted personnel generally had minimal rank display on everyday clothing. On some uniforms, the shoulder board could carry a letter or emblem indicating affiliation rather than a detailed rank. Such markings helped distinguish broad categories—such as armed forces or naval personnel—and also identified students in military educational institutions. Cadets and school pupils could be marked by letters associated with their academy or training track, while naval trainees might use an anchor motif rather than a letter.

Non-commissioned officers used more explicit rank cues. Their shoulder boards combined branch identifiers with stripes that indicated progression through NCO grades. Color and finish depended on the uniform: field gear used muted tones, whereas service and ceremonial uniforms used brighter or metallic-looking trim. This made it possible to preserve readability without compromising practical considerations in the field.

Warrant officers and their naval equivalents occupied an intermediate category. Their shoulder boards often resembled those of enlisted and NCO personnel in overall shape and branch marking, but rank was shown by small stars set in a vertical pattern. This star arrangement provided a clear visual separation from both stripe-based NCO insignia and the larger star systems used for commissioned officers.

For commissioned officers, star size and the presence of decorative borders signaled status and level of command. Junior officers typically used simpler boards with basic ornamentation and smaller metal stars. Field-grade and staff officers used more elaborate layouts, including additional vertical elements and larger stars. The most senior appointments used richer embroidery, with prominent stars and, at the very top, state symbols such as the Russian coat of arms.

These conventions were later superseded by updated standards introduced by presidential decree in 2010, following a transition period that began with new uniform issues in the late 2000s. The result was a revised, legally defined insignia system intended to modernize appearance while maintaining continuity in how rank and role are displayed."
"Castillo de San José is a coastal fortress in Arrecife, the capital of Lanzarote in Spain’s Canary Islands, and it is now best known for housing a museum devoted to modern and contemporary art. The building combines military architecture from the late eighteenth century with a later cultural role that reflects the island’s efforts to preserve heritage while expanding public access to the arts.

Construction took place between 1776 and 1779, during a period of severe hardship on Lanzarote. The island had suffered long-term damage from the Timanfaya volcanic eruptions earlier in the century, and repeated droughts further reduced agricultural output. In response to poverty and food shortages, the Spanish crown supported public works that could provide wages as well as infrastructure. The fortress therefore served two purposes: it offered employment to residents in crisis, and it strengthened defenses against maritime threats, including pirate raids that had been a recurring concern for Atlantic islands.

The fort occupies a strategic position above the Puerto de Naos area, looking out across the sea approaches to Arrecife. Its plan is adapted to coastal defense, with rounded seaward-facing walls designed to better withstand cannon fire and to widen the field of view. The landward side was more controlled, incorporating additional protective elements and a restricted entrance. Built from local stone, including volcanic materials, the structure contains a series of vaulted interior spaces that were suited to storage and military use, such as keeping supplies and ammunition under stable conditions.

In the second half of the twentieth century, the site underwent a major transformation. Rather than remaining a purely historic monument, it was refurbished to become an arts venue, with design interventions led by the Lanzarote-born artist and architect César Manrique. The museum that opened in the 1970s became known as the International Museum of Contemporary Art (MIAC). Its collection emphasizes art from the postwar decades, particularly works associated with abstraction and experimentation, including sculpture, kinetic pieces, and geometric or informal abstract painting. Spanish artists are especially prominent, and the museum also highlights creators connected to the Canary Islands.

The fort’s courtyard and surrounding areas are used for displaying works in open air, linking the art to the landscape and the building’s distinctive silhouette. An additional renovation created a restaurant within an adjoining section, connected internally and designed to take advantage of the sweeping views over the harbor, making the site both a cultural destination and a prominent landmark on Lanzarote’s coastline."
"Monument Park is the outdoor walkway beyond center field at Yankee Stadium, the home of the New York Yankees. It functions as both a passageway for fans and a public tribute to the players, managers, and executives who shaped the franchise. Although it sits within a modern ballpark, the idea behind the space is rooted in an older tradition: the Yankees long maintained a dedicated area for plaques and retired numbers, treating the stadium itself as a museum of team history.

The park is arranged as a landscaped exhibit that can be viewed from the concourse. Along the perimeter are bronze plaques that summarize achievements and highlight key moments. Nearby, a row of large numbers marks the jerseys that the organization has taken out of circulation in honor of iconic figures. Together, the plaques and numbers help explain why certain names carry special weight, even for visitors who may not know the details of different eras of baseball.

Several monuments stand out for their scale and prominence, often dedicated to legendary Yankees such as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Joe DiMaggio. These pieces are not simply decorative; they represent how baseball teams preserve collective memory in a way that resembles civic memorials. The names and dates provide an accessible timeline, while the surrounding design encourages fans to pause and read rather than simply pass by on the way to their seats.

Because the area is visible to the public, it also shapes the pregame routine. Fans frequently gather along the railings to take photos, point out familiar numbers, or compare the careers of different honorees. In this sense, Monument Park plays a role similar to a small exhibit hall: it offers context for what is happening on the field by emphasizing the continuity between past and present.

The location near center field is practical as well. It makes the tribute space easy to reach from multiple gates and places it close to concessions and other fan amenities. The result is a setting where history and entertainment sit side by side, reinforcing the idea that a baseball game is not only a competition, but also part of an ongoing story that the stadium is designed to tell."
"Arba Minch Airport serves the city of Arba Minch in southern Ethiopia, within the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region. The city’s name is sometimes written in different Latin spellings, and the airport is commonly referred to by those variants as well. The airfield lies a short distance from the urban centre, positioned near the lakes that characterize the area, including Lake Abaya, making it an important access point for residents, officials, and visitors traveling to the Rift Valley region.

The airport is built on elevated terrain, which influences aircraft performance and operational planning. It has a single paved runway identified by the numbers 03 and 21, indicating its approximate compass headings. The runway surface is asphalt-based, suitable for regular domestic operations using small and medium-sized aircraft. Basic aviation infrastructure supports routine passenger handling and airfield services, allowing scheduled flights to connect Arba Minch with larger hubs in Ethiopia. As with many regional airports, the range of destinations can change depending on airline schedules, seasonal demand, and broader network planning.

Beyond civilian transport, the airport has also drawn attention for security-related activity. In the early 2010s, public reporting indicated that U.S. forces were using the location to support surveillance missions in the Horn of Africa, including reconnaissance flights associated with monitoring militant groups in Somalia. Statements attributed to U.S. military representatives described a limited footprint focused on operational and technical assistance, and emphasized cooperation dependent on approval from Ethiopian authorities. Reports also noted that investments were made to improve facilities for unmanned aircraft operations, while suggesting that missions were oriented toward intelligence collection rather than launching strikes from the airfield. Over time, the regional basing and deployment arrangements for such systems have shifted, with some related sites elsewhere being scaled down or closed."
"Kolkata TV is a round-the-clock Bengali-language news broadcaster that began operations in 2006 under the umbrella of SST Media. The channel’s early formation is associated with journalist Suman Chattopadhyay, who had earlier worked with ABP and played a key role in shaping the station’s initial direction. Over time, the network came under the control of Kaustuv Ray, who is linked to the RP Group and has also served as the channel’s editor. Its on-air tagline, “Raatdin Saatdin,” conveys the idea of continuous news coverage throughout the week.

The channel is operated by RP Techvision (I) Pvt Ltd, based in Kolkata. In the public sphere, Kolkata TV has often been identified with an editorial posture that scrutinizes the Narendra Modi-led central government while appearing comparatively accommodating toward the Trinamool Congress (TMC), a major political force in West Bengal. Such perceptions have contributed to the channel’s distinct positioning within the state’s competitive regional media environment.

Kolkata TV and its owner have also drawn attention due to a series of legal and regulatory developments. Kaustuv Ray has faced investigative actions by central agencies, including Enforcement Directorate (ED) searches reported in 2018. He was later arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection with allegations related to bank fraud involving substantial sums. Reports also mention that he received further ED communication in 2021.

Around the same period, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting issued a formal notice to the channel asking why its broadcasting authorization should not be withdrawn. The communication cited the Ministry of Home Affairs’ decision regarding security clearance as the basis for potential cancellation. Ray publicly argued that the measure was intended to curb critical journalism and intimidate outlets that challenge those in power.

The episode triggered political debate and drew statements of support for the channel from several opposition parties and prominent figures, including leaders from West Bengal and other states. In subsequent court proceedings, interim legal protections were reported, including directions limiting coercive action and judicial scrutiny of the government’s notice."
"The 2021 Nottingham Trophy was a professional tennis event held on outdoor grass courts in Nottingham, United Kingdom. It formed part of two competitive circuits: the men’s tournament belonged to the ATP Challenger Tour, while the women’s tournament was included on the ITF Women’s World Tennis Tour. Matches were played over one week from 14 to 20 June 2021, serving as a lead-up opportunity for players preparing for the grass-court season.

As in most tournaments, the singles draws were built from several entry categories. Seeded players were determined by their world rankings from late May 2021. In addition to direct acceptances, a number of competitors entered through wildcards, which are invitations granted by the organizers, often to support local players or promising young athletes. On the men’s side, wildcards were given to Jay Clarke, Anton Matusevich, and Aidan McHugh. One player, Tomáš Macháč, was admitted using a protected ranking, a mechanism that helps athletes return to competition after a long injury absence.

Other places in the men’s main draw were filled by alternates, including Thomas Fabbiano, Leonardo Mayer, and Go Soeda. Several players advanced through qualifying, such as Alex Bolt, Marius Copil, Ernesto Escobedo, and Ramkumar Ramanathan, while Zhang Zhizhen entered as a lucky loser after a withdrawal.

The women’s draw also featured wildcards, awarded to Jodie Burrage, Samantha Murray Sharan, Matilda Mutavdzic, and Emma Raducanu. Qualifiers included Cristina Bucșa, Mayo Hibi, Monica Niculescu, Arina Rodionova, Storm Sanders, and Daria Snigur.

In the finals, Alex Bolt won the men’s singles title, and Alison Van Uytvanck claimed the women’s singles championship. The doubles trophies went to Marc Polmans and Matt Reid in the men’s event, and to Monica Niculescu and Elena-Gabriela Ruse in the women’s competition."
"Shaba Hills Wildlife Reserve is a protected conservation area in northern Kenya, within Isiolo County. It was first set aside in the mid‑20th century as part of a broader network of game areas intended to safeguard wildlife and water sources in the arid north. Over time, its limits and management arrangements were refined, and today the reserve is overseen by local authorities in cooperation with national conservation bodies and nearby communities. Because it lies on a well-known safari circuit, several lodges and tented camps operate in and around the reserve, offering guided drives and nature walks.

Geographically, Shaba Hills lies close to other protected lands along the Ewaso Ng’iro River system, which acts as a natural corridor for wildlife moving between seasonal grazing and permanent water. The terrain is shaped by ancient volcanic activity: dark basalt outcrops, weathered lava terraces, and open plains that gently rise into low rocky ridges. These landforms influence drainage, creating pockets where groundwater reaches the surface as springs or seepage areas. The climate is characteristically hot and semi‑arid, with irregular rainfall and long dry periods that make access to reliable water especially important for both animals and people.

Vegetation varies with soil and moisture. Along riverbanks and seasonal channels, denser woodland can form, with tall acacias and palms providing shade and nesting sites. Away from water, drought-tolerant bushland dominates, including thorny shrubs and resinous species such as Commiphora. On exposed lava, plant cover becomes sparse, while occasional alkaline flats support tough grasses that green up quickly after rains. Succulents and flowering shrubs appear in scattered patches, adding brief bursts of color during favorable seasons. Some trees are valued locally for practical uses, such as chewing sticks for dental care and browse for livestock.

The reserve supports a wide range of wildlife adapted to dry landscapes. Zebras, giraffes, elephants, and antelope species such as gerenuk and oryx are common sights, while predators including lion, leopard, and cheetah follow the distribution of prey. Birds are especially diverse, from raptors riding thermals above the plains to waterbirds concentrated at pools. In the riverine sections, crocodiles and hippos may be present where deeper water persists."
"Hospitals in Maine can be grouped by the communities they serve, reflecting the state’s mix of small coastal towns, inland regional hubs, and sparsely populated northern counties. In the capital area of Augusta (Kennebec County), major facilities include MaineGeneral Medical Center’s Alfond Center for Health, along with Riverview Psychiatric Center, a state psychiatric hospital that has operated under earlier names in the past.

Bangor (Penobscot County) functions as a key medical center for eastern Maine. Large institutions there include Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center, St. Joseph Hospital, Northern Light Acadia Hospital, and the Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center, which also has a history of previous institutional names. Farther down the coast in Hancock County, Mount Desert Island Hospital serves Bar Harbor, while Northern Light Blue Hill Hospital supports the Blue Hill area. Ellsworth is home to Northern Light Maine Coast Hospital.

Several midcoast and central Maine towns host community hospitals. Belfast (Waldo County) has Waldo County General Hospital, and Rockport (Knox County) is served by Penobscot Bay Medical Center. In Brunswick (Cumberland County), Mid Coast Hospital is a key provider, and Portland, the largest city in Maine, includes Maine Medical Center and Northern Light Mercy Hospital. Westbrook also hosts Spring Harbor Hospital.

Rural regions rely on smaller hospitals that provide emergency care and basic inpatient services. Examples include Bridgton Hospital (Cumberland County), Calais Regional Hospital and Down East Community Hospital in Machias (Washington County), and Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington (Franklin County). Northern and western Maine facilities include Cary Medical Center in Caribou, Northern Maine Medical Center in Fort Kent, Houlton Regional Hospital, Northern Light A.R. Gould Hospital in Presque Isle, and Stephens Memorial Hospital in Norway. Additional community hospitals serve towns such as Lewiston, Skowhegan, Rumford, and Dover-Foxcroft, helping maintain access across long travel distances."
"Liam Henderson (born 14 July 1979) is an Australian former lightweight rower who competed internationally in both sculling and sweep disciplines. Across a career spanning his junior years through to senior selection, he raced at major regattas including World Cups and World Championships, earned an under‑23 world title, and contributed to a medal-winning crew at the senior level.

**Club and state rowing**  
Henderson grew up in the Hawkesbury region of New South Wales and learned the sport through local river rowing before progressing to senior competition with the Hawkesbury River Rowing Club. Like many Australian lightweight athletes, he balanced domestic racing with selection trials that determined state and national crews.

His first significant domestic results came in age-category events, where he developed a reputation as a technically tidy sculler. Competing in club colours at the Australian Rowing Championships, he won a national under‑23 lightweight sculling title in the late 1990s. Those performances brought him to the attention of state selectors, and he later raced for New South Wales at the Interstate Regatta in the men’s lightweight four, the crew that contests the Penrith Cup. He appeared in that event more than once, reflecting consistent standing within the state’s lightweight squad.

**International representative rowing**  
Henderson’s Australian representative pathway began in the mid‑1990s, when he was selected for junior national crews. He first raced overseas as part of a quad scull at the Nations Cup (the major under‑23 regatta of the era), gaining early experience against European programs. In the same season he went on to contest the Junior World Rowing Championships, an event that often exposes young athletes to the demands of travel, unfamiliar conditions, and multi-round racing.

He also took part in a junior Trans‑Tasman series against New Zealand, a set of annual match races used by both countries to develop depth and evaluate emerging athletes. Returning the following year for the same series, he strengthened his case for under‑23 selection.

By 1997 Henderson had progressed into the under‑23 lightweight double scull, where he and his crewmate reached the podium at the World Rowing U23 Championships. The next step came in 1999, when he debuted in senior international competition at a World Rowing Cup regatta in the lightweight single scull. That season he peaked at the U23 World Championships, where he won the lightweight single scull and secured an under‑23 world championship title.

After transitioning from sculling into sweep rowing, Henderson earned selection in Australia’s men’s lightweight eight, a boat class that requires precise rhythm and high aerobic capacity. The crew achieved strong results on the World Cup circuit and later raced at the World Rowing Championships, where they finished on the medal dais. He continued to compete across both sculling and sweep boats into the early 2000s, including further World Cup appearances and a final World Championships campaign before retiring from international representation."
"Friedrich Wilhelm Heller (3 May 1801 in Ulm – 18 February 1874 in Karlsruhe) was a German physician known for his work in internal medicine and anatomical research. He began his medical training at the universities of Würzburg and Munich, completing his doctorate in 1822. After finishing his studies, he broadened his practical experience by working in teaching hospitals in Prague and Leipzig, where he observed new approaches to bedside instruction and post‑mortem examination.

In 1825 Heller entered public service as a medical officer attached to a cavalry unit stationed near Mannheim. A few years later he moved to Karlsruhe, where he combined military duties with responsibilities at a civic hospital. In 1831 he undertook a study journey to Paris and Edinburgh, focusing on clinical methods, hospital organization, and the growing use of microscopy in pathology.

From 1834 until his retirement in 1866, Heller held a chair in clinical medicine at the University of Heidelberg. He delivered lectures on diagnosis and therapeutics and encouraged students to connect symptoms with organ changes seen in autopsy findings. Alongside his academic work, he served as a medical adviser to the government of Baden, contributing to discussions on sanitation, epidemic control, and the regulation of medical practice.

Heller is also remembered for early arguments that many diseases arise from alterations at the smallest structural level of tissues, a view that anticipated later cellular explanations in medicine. His publications included a study on inflammatory processes (1828), a collection of clinical case reports (1836), a two‑volume handbook of internal diseases (1845–1846), and a later essay on practical treatment principles (1865)."
"Ometepe Airport is the main air facility serving Ometepe, a large island located in Lake Nicaragua. It sits near the community of La Paloma in the municipality of Moyogalpa, within the Rivas Department, a short distance south of the town center. Opened in 2014 after a multi‑million‑dollar construction project, the airport was designed to fit the island’s narrow lowlands between the lake and the nearby volcanic terrain.

The runway lies close to the water’s edge, so aircraft approaching from the west typically fly over Lake Nicaragua. To the east, the land rises quickly toward the slopes of Concepción volcano, a prominent landmark that influences local flight paths and navigation considerations.

Pilots in the region also rely on radio navigation aids located on the mainland, including the Managua VOR/DME to the northwest and the Liberia VOR/DME farther to the south. These beacons help aircraft maintain routes and position, especially in changing weather.

Scheduled service is limited. One domestic carrier operates periodic circuit flights that connect the island with other Nicaraguan airports, including Managua on selected days. While the airport has facilities for immigration and customs, routine international commercial flights are not currently offered. Charter operations and private aircraft, such as small planes and helicopters, also use the terminal."
"Imran Masood, HI(M), is a retired senior officer of the Pakistan Army who held several high-profile appointments at General Headquarters (GHQ), including service as Chief of General Staff during the early 2010s. The CGS role is widely regarded as one of the most influential staff positions in the army because it coordinates operational planning, manages inter-branch staff work, and supports the Chief of Army Staff in translating policy decisions into military directives. Over a long career, Masood built a reputation as an officer with experience spanning command, training, and strategic planning.

Masood was commissioned into the Armoured Corps in the mid-1970s after graduating from the Pakistan Military Academy. Like many officers who rise to the highest ranks, he completed a sequence of professional military education courses. These typically include the Command and Staff College in Quetta, where officers are trained in staff procedures and operational art, and the National Defence University in Islamabad, which focuses on higher-level strategy, civil-military relations, and national security policy. He also attended a foreign staff course in Turkey, reflecting the practice of sending selected officers abroad to broaden exposure to different doctrines and coalition planning methods.

During his mid-career years, Masood alternated between field command and staff responsibilities. He served as a brigade major in an armoured formation and later worked as an instructor at leading training institutions, including the Pakistan Military Academy and the School of Infantry and Tactics. Instructional postings are significant in the army’s career structure because they place officers in roles where they shape curricula, mentor younger officers, and contribute to professional standards. On the command side, he led an armoured regiment and later commanded brigades in both armoured and infantry settings, assignments that required balancing mobility, firepower, and coordination with supporting arms.

His staff experience included postings in the Military Operations Directorate, where officers handle operational monitoring, contingency planning, and coordination with corps headquarters. After promotion to major general in the mid-2000s, Masood commanded a mechanized division in southern Punjab, a role combining administration, training oversight, and readiness planning. He subsequently served as Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations, acting as the army’s principal spokesperson and overseeing public communication during a period of heightened security attention.

Later, he moved to GHQ’s planning and evaluation functions. As Director General Planning at the COAS Secretariat, he worked within a policy-focused environment often described as the army’s internal planning hub. He then served as Vice Chief of General Staff before promotion to lieutenant general and appointment as Inspector General Training and Evaluation, supervising training standards, exercises, and evaluation systems across formations. He ultimately became Chief of General Staff, after which he retired from active service.

Masood is married and has three children."
"Sriboonruang Wittayakarn School, often known locally as Sibunrueang, is a major public secondary school in Nong Bua Lamphu Province, northeastern Thailand. The campus is situated in Ban Santisuk (Mu 13) within Sriboonrueng District and serves as one of the central educational institutions for students in the surrounding communities. Administratively, the school operates under the regional Secondary Educational Service Area Office responsible for overseeing public secondary education in the province.

The school’s establishment is closely tied to the limited access to upper-level schooling in earlier decades. Before the mid-1970s, many students who completed primary education in the district faced difficulties continuing their studies because the nearest secondary schools were located far away and transportation options were limited. Local leaders and residents therefore pushed for a district-based secondary school. Initial planning began several years earlier, but the effort progressed slowly until district authorities compiled the necessary documentation and submitted it to national education agencies. Formal approval was granted in 1974, marking the beginning of the school as an official government institution.

When the school first opened to students in 1974, it started with only a small number of classes and a modest first intake. Demand quickly increased, and over time the school expanded its buildings, teaching staff, and grade-level offerings. Today it provides both lower secondary and upper secondary education, with a range of academic programs designed to prepare students for higher education and vocational pathways. Like many Thai secondary schools, it also tracks performance through national assessments in core subjects such as Thai language, mathematics, science, social studies, and English."
"Ralph McQuarrie (1929–2012) was an American illustrator and conceptual artist whose futuristic imagery helped shape the look of modern science-fiction film. He is most widely associated with the original Star Wars trilogy, where his paintings guided sets, costumes, vehicles, and the overall atmosphere of a galaxy far from Earth. McQuarrie’s work is often described as a bridge between written ideas and what audiences eventually see on screen, translating scripts into believable worlds through detailed visual planning.

McQuarrie was born in Gary, Indiana, and developed an interest in drawing and engineering-related subjects early in life. After serving in the U.S. Army, he studied at the Art Center School in Los Angeles, building a foundation in illustration and design. Before entering the film industry, he worked as a commercial artist, producing technical and promotional artwork that required clarity, precision, and strong draftsmanship—skills that later proved useful in concept design.

His transition into entertainment design accelerated in the mid-1970s, when filmmaker George Lucas sought visual development for a space adventure that had not yet been fully realized on film. McQuarrie produced a series of paintings that established key ideas for Star Wars, including interpretations of characters, spacecraft, and environments. Several of his designs directly influenced elements that became iconic, and his artwork was frequently used as a reference point for construction teams and special-effects departments. In this way, his paintings were not merely marketing images; they functioned as practical blueprints for production.

Following this breakthrough, McQuarrie contributed to other major projects, continuing to refine the visual language of science fiction. He worked on Close Encounters of the Third Kind, developing concepts related to spacecraft and lighting. Later, he provided designs for The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, helping to expand the universe introduced in the first film. He also contributed to E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, where his work supported the creation of locations, props, and mood.

A notable aspect of McQuarrie’s approach was his ability to make imaginative technology appear functional. He often combined real-world industrial details with dramatic composition, suggesting how a machine might be built, used, and maintained. This grounded quality helped audiences accept extraordinary settings as coherent places. Although concept art is typically produced behind the scenes, McQuarrie’s images became widely circulated through books, exhibitions, and documentaries, highlighting the importance of visual development in filmmaking.

McQuarrie’s legacy rests on the idea that design can define a story’s identity. By providing a consistent visual direction early in production, he influenced not only individual films but also the broader expectations of what cinematic science fiction could look like."
"Marco Bianchi (born 12 March 1950) is an Italian economist and academic based in Rome. He has spent much of his career at Sapienza University of Rome, where he completed his university studies and earned a degree in Economics in the early 1970s. His training was grounded in both economic theory and institutional analysis, an approach that later informed his teaching and administrative work within the university.

Over the years, Bianchi has held several governance and leadership positions connected to Sapienza’s Faculty of Law. In addition to teaching economics-related subjects to law students, he has coordinated initiatives aimed at strengthening the links between legal studies, public finance, and the organization of markets. He has served as head of an institute focused on economic and financial matters within the faculty, and has also taken responsibilities connected to internal evaluation procedures, such as reviewing teaching quality and supporting the assessment of departmental performance.

Beyond his roles at the university, Bianchi has contributed to national research oversight. He has acted as a reviewer for competitive research programs funded by the Italian Ministry responsible for universities and scientific research, evaluating proposals and monitoring ongoing projects. He has also participated in internal inspection and compliance activities, which in Italian universities often involve checking administrative regularity and ensuring that academic structures follow established regulations.

His involvement in postgraduate education includes participation in scientific committees for doctoral and master’s programs, particularly in areas where economics intersects with commercial law, European private law, and public policy. In these settings, he has helped define curricula, assess academic standards, and supervise research paths for early-career scholars.

During the earlier phase of his career, Bianchi received recognition for his graduation thesis, which was awarded in a competition sponsored by a local banking foundation. He has also served on academic selection panels at the national level, taking part in evaluation commissions for appointments and promotions across different ranks of the Italian university system.

Bianchi’s professional profile reflects a combination of scholarship, institutional service, and participation in research evaluation, typical of senior Italian academics working at large public universities."
"Kandola Kalan is a rural settlement in the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district of Punjab, India. It lies within the Doaba region and is connected to nearby market towns by local roads. For postal and administrative purposes, the village falls under the service area of a nearby head post office, while the district headquarters at Nawanshahr and the state capital Chandigarh can be reached by road. Like most villages in Punjab, local civic matters are handled through a Gram Panchayat system, led by a Sarpanch who is chosen through village-level elections.

According to the 2011 Census of India, Kandola Kalan had 372 households and a population of 1,734 residents. Of these, 904 were males and 830 were females. The village reported a literacy rate of 79.6%, which is above the overall literacy level recorded for Punjab in the same census period. Children aged six and below numbered 171, representing just under one-tenth of the total population. The child sex ratio was notably higher than the state average, indicating a comparatively larger number of girls per thousand boys in the youngest age group.

Social composition in the village includes a substantial share of residents belonging to Scheduled Castes, forming roughly two-thirds of the population. As in many parts of this district, the Scheduled Tribe population is either very small or not recorded. Work participation figures show that 658 people were engaged in some form of economic activity, including 497 men and 161 women. Most workers were classified as main workers, meaning they were employed for more than six months of the year, while the remaining group carried out seasonal or short-term work.

In education, the village is served by a Punjabi-medium government school offering primary and upper primary classes. The school follows national guidelines for free and compulsory schooling for children aged 6 to 14 and provides cooked meals under the Mid-Day Meal programme. For higher education, students typically commute to colleges in nearby towns such as Banga or Nawanshahr, while larger private universities are accessible in other parts of Punjab.

For transport, the nearest railway facilities are found in the surrounding towns, with broader connectivity available from larger stations in the district. Domestic air travel is generally accessed through the airport in Ludhiana, while international flights are available from Chandigarh and Amritsar."
"Emma Chambers (1848–1933) was an English mezzo-soprano and stage performer whose career bridged Victorian London and the rapidly growing theatrical scene of Australia. Known for lively character work as well as singing roles, she became especially familiar to audiences in the Australian colonies during the 1880s and early 1890s.

Chambers first gained wide notice in London through parts that mixed music with comedy and disguise. Early successes included breeches roles in which she played male characters onstage, a popular convention in the period. Her appearances at prominent venues helped establish her reputation for energetic acting and clear vocal delivery, and she soon moved between pantomime, comic plays, and light opera—genres that drew large mixed audiences and relied on performers with versatility rather than purely operatic technique.

During the mid-1870s she worked under contract in productions of fashionable continental operettas, which were often adapted for English stages. These engagements placed her in a circuit of major London theatres where French and German works were translated, revised, and mounted with elaborate staging. She later took on named roles in well-known operettas by composers such as Lecocq and Planquette, including a notable engagement at a central London theatre arranged by a leading theatre proprietor of the day. By 1880 she was also appearing in English comic opera, reflecting the period’s appetite for locally written works that blended popular song styles with theatrical comedy.

In October 1884 Chambers travelled to Australia under contract to a major theatrical partnership to repeat a role that had brought her recognition in Britain. Melbourne audiences, in particular, welcomed imported performers from London, and Chambers quickly became part of touring companies that carried large-scale productions between colonial capitals. Over the next years she appeared in a range of popular dramas and melodramas, taking on parts that demanded strong characterisation as much as vocal ability.

In 1889 she left Australia for South Africa with a company formed under her leadership, travelling by steamship with members of her family and troupe. After a visit to England in 1891, she returned again to the southern hemisphere, passing through South Africa and then Australia, where she performed in a production mounted by a leading actor-manager.

By the early twentieth century Chambers was back on the English stage, including a substantial role in a London theatre in 1901. In her personal life she married Albert Marsh, who also acted as her manager, and she was at times associated with another married name. She died in 1933, remembered as a capable, adaptable performer whose career followed the pathways of the British Empire’s theatre circuits."
"The 4th Canadian Film Awards took place on April 27, 1952, recognizing notable work in Canadian cinema across a range of formats. The event was presided over by Sidney Earle Smith, who at the time served as president of the University of Toronto. Awards were organized into categories that reflected both theatrical productions and films made for educational or institutional use, with additional acknowledgements given through honourable mentions.

In the top prize category, Film of the Year went to *Newfoundland Scene*, produced by F. R. Crawley. The award for Theatrical Feature was presented to *Royal Journey*, credited to David Bairstow, Gudrun Parker, and Roger Blais, while *Little Aurore’s Tragedy (La petite Aurore, l’enfant martyre)* received an honourable mention. The Theatrical Short category recognized *Opera School* (Gudrun Parker), alongside honourable mentions for *The Fruitful Earth*, *Man in the Peace Tower*, and *Struggle for Oil*.

Non-theatrical awards were further divided by sponsorship. *Newfoundland Scene* also won in the open non-theatrical division, with other works cited for distinction, including *The Longhouse People* and *Les Moines de Saint-Benoît-du-Lac*. In government-sponsored non-theatrical film, *Milk Made* received the main award, and *Ski à Québec* was commended. *Packaged Power* led the non-government sponsored group, while several club and university productions were also acknowledged. A special award honoured Norman McLaren for innovative research reflected in *Around Is Around* and *Now Is the Time*."
"BWI Group (BeijingWest Industries) is an automotive components supplier specializing in braking and suspension technologies. The company is headquartered in Beijing, China, and serves a broad customer base that includes passenger car makers, motorcycle brands, and manufacturers of specialized vehicles. A major turning point came in 2009, when BWI acquired Delphi’s Chassis Division, adding established product lines and engineering capability to its portfolio. The acquisition was reported at roughly $100 million and helped position the firm as a global supplier.

Although the BWI name dates from the 2009 transaction, much of the technical heritage behind its products traces back to earlier North American chassis and brake organizations that evolved through multiple corporate names over the 20th century. This long development path reflects the way braking and suspension systems have advanced from primarily mechanical devices to integrated, electronically controlled safety platforms.

BWI’s manufacturing footprint is international, with production operations in several regions, including China and a number of European locations such as Poland, the United Kingdom, and the Czech Republic, along with facilities in Mexico. This spread supports proximity to vehicle assembly plants and helps meet regional supply requirements.

The product range has expanded over time from early shock absorbers to sophisticated chassis systems. Historical milestones include drum brake hydraulics, welded damper designs, vacuum brake boosters, and the introduction of disc brake components. Later decades brought anti-lock braking systems, modular struts, electronic stability control, and adaptive damping technologies. In the 2000s, magnetorheological damping systems became prominent, and ABS solutions were extended to motorcycle applications."
"Ashani Kemarley Brown (born 20 July 1992) is a sprinter known for racing the 100 metres and 200 metres. Competing at elite level, he has recorded a best of 9.93 seconds over 100 m, a time that places him among the faster athletes of his generation. His career has included representing more than one nation and combining athletics with studies in the United States.

Brown began his international exposure while still a junior athlete for Jamaica. One of his earliest achievements came in relay competition, where he helped Jamaica’s 4 × 100 metres team secure a medal at the CARIFTA Games in 2011. That success suggested strong promise, although his progress was later slowed by injuries that disrupted training and competition during a key development period.

To continue both education and sport, Brown relocated to the United States and enrolled at Merritt College in Oakland, California. Competing in the American junior college system, he made steady improvements, particularly in strength and race durability. He became a leading performer at the California Community College level and earned state titles in the 100 m. A major breakthrough came at the CCCAA State Track and Field Championships in 2014, where he ran 9.93 seconds. The performance was significant not only as a personal best, but also for its standing within junior college athletics, and it ranked highly worldwide for that season. In the same year, he also posted a 200 m best of 20.38 seconds, placing him competitively on international seasonal lists.

In 2015, Brown continued racing on the Caribbean circuit, including appearances at meets in Kingston. Later that year he initiated a change in sporting nationality, requesting a transfer of allegiance from Jamaica to Bahrain. Such moves are governed by international athletics regulations and typically involve approval processes before an athlete can represent a new country in major championships.

Brown went on to compete for Bahrain at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. In the men’s 100 m, he progressed through the opening round and reached the semi-finals, running 10.13 seconds in the qualifying stage. His primary personal bests remain 9.93 seconds for 100 m and 20.38 seconds for 200 m, both achieved in 2014."
"What Remains is a short work by the German author Christa Wolf that explores the psychological effects of political monitoring in the former German Democratic Republic. Although it was composed in 1979, it appeared in print only in 1990, a delay that reflects the political sensitivities surrounding its subject and the changes that followed the collapse of East Germany.

The narrative follows a single ordinary day experienced by an unnamed woman who senses that state security agents are tracking her movements and professional life. Instead of focusing on dramatic events, the text concentrates on how constant observation reshapes routine behavior. Simple actions—answering the phone, speaking with friends, leaving the apartment—become calculated choices. The protagonist’s home no longer feels private; it becomes a space where every word might be recorded or misinterpreted.

Wolf presents surveillance not only as an external system but also as an internal condition. The woman begins to scrutinize herself as harshly as she imagines others do. Doubt and anxiety influence her body as well as her thoughts, producing signs of stress such as sleeplessness and nervous agitation. Social life shrinks because trust becomes difficult: casual conversations are replaced by guarded remarks, hints, and indirect language.

A recurring element is her fascination with the watchers themselves. She wonders about their motives, their everyday habits, and whether they can separate their work from their private lives. This curiosity reveals how surveillance creates a distorted relationship between observer and observed, binding them together even without direct contact.

Told in a reflective first-person voice, the novella draws readers into an ongoing inner commentary. By the end, encounters with younger people at a public reading suggest that fear can be challenged, and that speaking openly may eventually become possible—even if the legacy of suspicion remains."
"A large carved elephant tusk showing episodes from the Buddha’s life is displayed in the Decorative Arts gallery of the National Museum in New Delhi. The object is fashioned from a single, intact tusk and measures close to five feet in length. It entered the museum collection as a donation and is generally attributed to skilled ivory workers active in the Delhi area in the early decades of the twentieth century. The tusk is notable both for its scale and for the dense narrative program cut into its curved surface.

Carving on whole tusks became an admired form of luxury craft in India during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with Delhi recognized as an important center, along with workshops in Burma. Comparable full-tusk carvings are known in parts of West and Central Africa as well, though those were typically made from African elephant ivory. In South Asia, ivory working has a long history: classical literature mentions finely made ivory objects, and archaeological finds indicate the presence of carved pieces from at least the early centuries of the Common Era. The practice expanded in regions such as Assam and Mysore, where access to elephants and support from royal courts helped sustain specialist artisans. Because ivory was widely traded, raw material and finished works circulated to places where patrons valued the craft.

The New Delhi tusk presents a continuous visual biography of the Buddha through forty-three circular medallions arranged in a spiraling sequence. The lower portion begins with events associated with his birth and youth and continues through key moments leading to awakening. The upper medallions then move to episodes after enlightenment, culminating in his final passing. While many scenes echo established Buddhist sculpture and painting, the tusk also includes less frequently illustrated moments, such as an early encounter involving compassion toward an injured animal and reflections that emphasize ethical change and the reality of death.

As the tusk narrows toward the tip, the carving shifts from narrative medallions to prominent iconic figures. Here, several well-known hand gestures are shown, including the earth-touching gesture, the gesture of reassurance, and the gesture associated with teaching. A band of scrolling floral ornament winds between the medallions, linking the episodes and providing a decorative framework for the story as it rises from base to tip."
"The Washington Road Elm Allée is a notable segment of Washington Road in West Windsor, New Jersey, where rows of elm trees frame the roadway and shape a distinctive approach to Princeton University. The tree-lined corridor passes through open university-owned fields and, together with the nearby crossing over Lake Carnegie, creates a strong visual gateway into the campus area. At the northern end of this landscaped stretch, the Delaware and Raritan Canal runs close to the road, linking the allée to one of central New Jersey’s best-known historic waterways.

A paved running and walking route follows the allée and serves as a connector between several destinations. From this corridor, pedestrians can continue onto the canal towpath, head toward Princeton’s main campus, or branch off onto additional trails that weave through surrounding meadows and farmland. Because it combines scenic views with practical access, the route is used for recreation as well as daily travel by students, residents, and visitors.

The planting of the original allée dates to the early twentieth century, when Princeton Nurseries played a major role in regional landscape projects. The trees were chosen for their upright form and their ability to create a shaded arch overhead as they matured. The Princeton Elm, a cultivated variety associated with the nursery, became particularly valued for its appearance and for improved tolerance to Dutch elm disease, which devastated elm populations across the United States. Over the decades, the allée has inevitably changed: some of the original trees have been lost to age, storms, and disease, while others have survived and grown into large specimens. To preserve the characteristic look of the corridor, replacement plantings have been added at different times, including other elm cultivars as well as a smaller number of non-elm trees.

Just east of the roadway, near the path, lies a small historic cemetery known as the Schenck-Covenhoven Burial Ground, also referred to locally as the Old Conover Graveyard. Enclosed by a stone boundary, it contains several dozen graves and is considered one of the oldest burial sites in the township, with interments dating back to the mid-1700s. The families associated with the site were early Dutch farming settlers in the area, and although the cemetery has not been used for many generations, it is still cared for on a limited basis."
"The CECAFA Club Cup is a regional football competition for club teams affiliated with the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (CECAFA). The event brings together leading sides from the association’s member countries and serves as an important platform for clubs that may not regularly appear in continental tournaments. Since the early 2000s, the tournament has also been widely referred to under a sponsored name, reflecting the role of external backing in keeping the competition active.

The origins of the cup go back to the late 1960s, when an early edition was played but later treated as unofficial in many records. After that initial attempt, the tournament experienced interruptions and did not develop into a consistent annual event until later in the 1970s, when a champion was formally recognised. Over time, the competition has continued to face occasional cancellations, often due to scheduling difficulties, funding constraints, or wider organisational issues.

Match outcomes in the CECAFA Club Cup have frequently been decided in knockout rounds. When finals end level after regulation time and extra time, champions are determined through penalty shootouts, which are recorded alongside the scoreline. Lists of winners typically distinguish between champions and runners-up and may include notes on club name changes and how titles are counted. Statistics are also commonly summarised by nation to show which countries’ clubs have been most successful."
"Samuel L. Rabinowitz (April 12, 1881 – June 3, 1938) was a Russian-born Jewish-American attorney, public official, and municipal judge associated with New York City politics in the early twentieth century. His career reflected a common path for immigrants of his generation: public schooling, professional training, work in local party organizations, and eventual service in government.

Rabinowitz was born on April 12, 1881 in Odessa, then part of the Russian Empire, to Leon and Fannie Rabinowitz. He arrived in the United States as a child and spent much of his youth on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, an area known for dense immigrant neighborhoods and active political clubs. He attended New York City public schools and later enrolled at the College of the City of New York, studying there from 1897 to 1900. Seeking a legal career, he continued to New York Law School and completed his degree in 1902. After admission to the bar, he opened a practice in lower Manhattan, maintaining offices near City Hall where many lawyers handled court and municipal matters.

Soon after establishing his practice, Rabinowitz became involved in Democratic Party organizations in his assembly district. He joined local political clubs, attended ward meetings, and worked on campaigns, activities that provided experience and connections in an era when party structures strongly influenced nominations and appointments. His visibility within the district helped him win election to the New York State Assembly, where he represented a Manhattan constituency beginning in 1909. He served two terms, focusing on legislation related to city administration, public safety, and court procedure. Though identified with the Democratic organization, he also gained support from reform-minded voters during a period when New York politics included frequent challenges from independent movements.

After leaving the Assembly, Rabinowitz returned to private practice while remaining active in civic affairs. He participated in legal associations and served on committees that addressed municipal governance and court efficiency. In 1926, he was elected to the Municipal Court of the City of New York, a busy trial court that handled a large volume of civil cases and minor criminal matters. As a judge, he was known for a steady courtroom style and attention to the practical effects of rulings on working residents and small businesses.

Rabinowitz married Rebecca Stein, and they had two children, Philip and Marian. He died on June 3, 1938 after a short illness and was buried at a Jewish cemetery in Queens. His professional life illustrates how immigrant lawyers could move from neighborhood advocacy to formal roles in New York’s legal and political institutions."
"Hans Richter (6 April 1888 – 1 February 1976) was a German painter, filmmaker, and writer known for connecting the European avant‑garde with the emerging language of experimental cinema. Active as both an organizer and a creator, he helped introduce abstract film to wider audiences and worked across several countries as political conditions in Europe shifted. His career illustrates how modernist art, journalism, and film production often overlapped in the first half of the twentieth century.

Richter was born in Berlin into a middle‑class family and trained in art at academies in Germany. During the First World War he became involved in artistic circles that questioned traditional forms and institutions. After the war he joined the Dada movement, collaborating with poets, designers, and musicians who favored collage, chance methods, and sharp cultural critique. These contacts were important because they provided a network of publishers, editors, and patrons who could support new work outside established galleries and studios.

In the early 1920s Richter began making abstract films that explored rhythm, contrast, and movement rather than narrative. Works such as *Rhythmus 21* and *Rhythmus 23* used animated geometric forms to investigate how editing and visual repetition could create a sense of time comparable to music. At a moment when cinema was still associated mainly with theatrical storytelling, these films argued that motion pictures could also function as a modern visual art. Richter wrote essays and gave lectures to explain these ideas, treating film as a distinct medium with its own grammar.

Alongside his filmmaking, he undertook editorial and organizational roles. He contributed to art journals, worked with exhibition groups, and promoted international exchanges between artists. This public work was not separate from his artistic output: it helped build an audience and a critical vocabulary for experimental film and modern design. During the late Weimar period he also collaborated with other filmmakers and photographers who were developing documentary and city‑film approaches, showing his ability to move between abstraction and socially oriented projects.

The political upheavals of the 1930s reshaped Richter’s life. As the Nazi regime targeted modernist artists and those with left‑leaning associations, he left Germany and lived in several European countries before eventually moving to the United States. In New York he taught, wrote about film history and technique, and continued to make and support independent productions. His work as a teacher mattered because it connected early European experimentation with later American avant‑garde cinema.

Richter’s legacy lies in his insistence that film could be both an artistic experiment and a form of critical commentary. By combining creative practice with editorial advocacy, he helped establish experimental cinema as a recognized field within twentieth‑century culture."
"Heathfield Park is a historic country estate in the village of Old Heathfield, East Sussex. The property is notable for its long sequence of owners, repeated architectural changes, and landscaped grounds that include both designed features and areas valued for wildlife.

The estate began life in the late seventeenth century as a private mansion set within parkland. Work started in 1677 under James Plummer, and further building followed in the early eighteenth century under Raymond Blackmore. Like many English country houses, it evolved in response to the tastes and ambitions of successive proprietors rather than being built to a single fixed plan.

A major turning point came in the 1760s when George Augustus Eliott acquired the property after accumulating significant wealth through military service, including prize money connected with the 1762 siege of Havana. Soon after his purchase, the house was expanded and updated in 1766 to designs by Robert Taylor, an architect who later received a knighthood. Eliott retained the estate until his death in 1790, and the house subsequently took the name Heathfield Park in recognition of his title.

In the following year, the new owner Francis Newbery, whose family was connected to the publisher John Newbery, employed landscape designer Humphrey Repton to improve the grounds. One of the most distinctive elements of the estate dates from this period: the Gibraltar Tower, built as a commemorative structure celebrating Eliott’s role in the defence of Gibraltar during the siege of 1779–1782. The tower combines an octagonal lower stage with a circular upper section, and visitors reach the top via a spiral stair contained within. It is listed at Grade II*, reflecting its architectural and historic interest.

During the nineteenth century, the estate served for decades as the home of the Blunt baronet family. Later, the art patron William Cleverley Alexander undertook a substantial remodelling in 1895, commissioning Sir Reginald Blomfield to reshape the house in a Georgian Revival manner. Among the visible changes were the replacement of stucco with brick facing and the addition of a new wing. Alexander died in 1916 after a fall inside the house.

In the mid-twentieth century the estate entered a new phase when Gerald Moore purchased it in 1963. He opened the gardens to the public, introduced equestrian facilities, restored the Gibraltar Tower in 1970, and later developed a wildlife park. The property was sold in 1993 and remains privately owned today.

Beyond its buildings, Heathfield Park includes an area designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. This status recognises the ecological value of the local ghyll woodland habitat and its county-important lichen communities. Part of the grounds also hosts Heathfield Park Cricket Club, established in 1878 and still supporting matches and training for adults and juniors."
"The Department of Civil, Geo and Environmental Engineering at the Technical University of Munich is based on the university’s Munich campus and brings together disciplines that deal with the built environment and natural systems. Its work spans classic civil engineering, the study of the Earth, and environmental technologies, with research and teaching aimed at improving infrastructure, managing resources, and understanding geological processes.

Within the department, chairs and research groups are commonly organized into several thematic clusters. One major area covers construction and building design, including energy-conscious architecture, building physics, and structural systems made from concrete, masonry, steel, and timber. Related fields examine construction materials and their performance, ranging from materials testing to methods that evaluate structures without causing damage.

A second cluster focuses on mobility and transportation. This includes traffic operations and control, as well as the planning and engineering of roads, railways, and airfields. Researchers also analyze transport systems and urban mobility patterns using modeling and simulation, supporting decisions in city and regional planning.

A third area concentrates on mechanics and management within engineering practice. Topics such as computational and structural mechanics, risk and reliability, and construction management address how complex projects are designed, assessed, and delivered. Real estate and infrastructure management may also be represented, reflecting the economic and organizational side of the built environment.

The fourth cluster highlights hydro- and geosciences. Research may involve hydrology, groundwater, river basin management, geothermal systems, landslides, and engineering geology, alongside urban water engineering and hydraulic design.

In addition, associated members contribute expertise in fields like geodesy, remote sensing, geoinformatics, land management, landscape planning, environmental monitoring, and digital fabrication. International subject rankings periodically evaluate the department’s broader fields, with positions varying by ranking organization and year."
"Lillias Margaret Skene (née Hamilton; 28 March 1867–25 March 1957) is remembered as an Australian advocate for women and a long-serving community organiser whose work linked social reform with practical support services.

Born in Smythesdale, Victoria, on 28 March 1867, she was the third child of John Prendergast Hamilton, a police magistrate originally from Scotland, and Agnes Margaret Hamilton (née Buchanan), who had English family connections. She was educated locally and later attended Alexandra College, where her schooling reflected the expectations of middle-class families at the time: a strong emphasis on discipline, civic responsibility, and preparation for public life through voluntary service.

On 7 November 1888, at St Mary’s Anglican Church in Caulfield, she married David Alexander Skene, a sheepmaster. Their early married years were marked by financial uncertainty, which shaped the family’s repeated moves and influenced Skene’s later interest in welfare and health initiatives. When employment drew her husband to New South Wales, she remained in Victoria with their children for extended periods, managing household responsibilities and maintaining family stability. The family reunited at rural stations near Bourke and later relocated several times in response to changing prospects in pastoral work.

In 1900 they moved to Manly, Sydney, where they attempted to earn a living from a small dairy operation on leased land. Drought conditions and the cost of fodder made the venture difficult, and by 1906 they returned to Melbourne. There, David Skene shifted into commercial work as a woolbroker and stock and station agent. In 1910, funds inherited from Lillias Skene’s mother enabled the purchase of a family home in South Yarra, providing a firmer base for her public activities.

Skene became involved in organised women’s networks in Victoria, including the National Council of Women. Working as an assistant secretary, she supported coordination between affiliated groups and helped sustain campaigns concerned with women’s status and social improvement. She also contributed to health administration, serving in roles connected to the governance of a women’s hospital committee and, during the First World War era, managing stores and operations for a Melbourne home hospital connected with Government House.

After gradually stepping back from many responsibilities in 1949, she moved to Brighton. She died in Armadale on 25 March 1957 and was buried at Brighton Cemetery. Her name endures in Skene Street in the Canberra suburb of Cook, reflecting recognition of her civic contribution."
"Ada Developers Academy is an intensive training program designed to prepare women and gender-expansive adults for entry-level roles in software development, particularly those who have not previously worked as professional programmers. One distinguishing feature of the academy is its tuition-free model, which helps reduce financial barriers to career change. To support participants with day-to-day costs while studying, the program also allows students to seek a small, low-interest loan intended for living expenses.

The curriculum is structured to combine guided instruction with real-world experience. Students typically begin with several months of full-time classroom learning, where they build a foundation in core programming concepts and modern web development practices. Coursework commonly emphasizes languages and tools used in industry, such as Python for backend development, JavaScript for interactive web applications, and frameworks and libraries used to build full products. Alongside coding skills, students study computer science essentials—topics like problem-solving approaches, data structures, and collaborative workflows that are necessary in professional engineering teams. HTML and CSS are also covered to support front-end fundamentals and user-facing design implementation.

After the instructional portion, participants move into a multi-month paid internship. These placements are hosted by technology companies in the Seattle area and are intended to give students experience working on production code, receiving feedback through code review, and collaborating with cross-functional teams. Partner organizations have included well-known firms across e-commerce, enterprise software, and consumer technology.

Ada started in the Seattle tech community and has grown with support from corporate sponsorships, private donations, and other public or community funding sources. Sponsors may contribute financially, offer mentors, and provide internship opportunities, while also sharing input about industry needs. Many companies engage with programs like this to broaden their hiring pipelines and strengthen diversity within technical roles."
"San Esteban is one of the municipalities located in the northeastern part of Honduras, within the department of Olancho. It lies between several well-known localities in the region: Dulce Nombre de Culmí is to the east, Gualaco to the west, and Catacamas to the south. The area has also appeared in literature, since a Costa Rican novelist, Óscar Núñez Oliva, used San Esteban as the setting for a novel published in 2000.

The municipality’s name commemorates friar Esteban Verdelete, a religious figure remembered for his work in spreading Christianity among communities in the zone. Local tradition identifies 1808 as the year of its establishment, linked to friar José Antonio Liendo y Goicoechea, who traveled from Guatemala and played a role in organizing the settlement. In its early years, the population included indigenous inhabitants who already lived in the surrounding lands.

Geographically, San Esteban occupies a section of the Agalta Valley and is traversed by the Grande de Agalta River, which is an important feature for the landscape and local agriculture. Its territory shares borders with Trujillo and Iriona to the north, Catacamas to the south, Dulce Nombre de Culmí to the east, and Gualaco to the west. Administratively, it includes more than twenty villages distributed across its valleys and hillsides."
"*The Ghost-Seer* (German: *Der Geisterseher – Aus den Papieren des Grafen von O***) is a prose work by Friedrich Schiller that occupies an unusual place in his career. Rather than being released at once as a finished book, it first reached readers in parts between 1787 and 1789 in Schiller’s periodical *Thalia*. Only later was it gathered and issued in multiple volumes. This publication history is important because the text reflects its serial origins: it shifts in pacing and emphasis, and it does not form a perfectly unified narrative arc.

The story is presented as a first-person account attributed to an unnamed “Count of O**,” who frames what follows as testimony rather than invention. He underscores that the events he describes may sound implausible but insists on their factuality, and he adopts the stance of a narrator who claims to have nothing to gain from persuading his readers. This device creates an atmosphere of documentary authenticity, which becomes especially effective as the plot moves into the territory of deception, staged marvels, and secret influence.

At the center of the narrative is a German prince who travels to Venice during the carnival season. The Venetian setting is not merely decorative: masks, anonymity, and spectacle support a sequence of encounters in which appearances are difficult to verify. The prince is gradually drawn into a web of manipulation involving a clandestine religious-political network, often described in terms of Jesuit intrigue. Their objective is to reshape his convictions and steer his future rule, using theatrical tricks and purported supernatural phenomena to break down his resistance and redirect his loyalties.

Alongside its sensational elements, the work also gestures toward the intellectual climate of the late Enlightenment. Schiller uses the prince’s predicament to explore tensions between impulse and ethical restraint, personal desire and public obligation. Digressions on religion, history, and the uses of power reveal a skeptical attitude toward institutional authority and highlight the period’s fascination with rational critique, even when the plot is fueled by apparitions and conspiracies.

Although Schiller never completed the novel, it achieved wide popularity in his lifetime, partly because it borrowed motifs associated with Gothic fiction—spiritualism, secret societies, and ominous “proofs” of the beyond. Readers and commentators have sometimes linked its themes to contemporary fascination with occult showmen and staged séances. The book also traveled early: an English version appeared around 1800, helping to establish its reputation outside German-speaking audiences. Later attempts to supply an ending, including a continuation published in the twentieth century, did not fully replace the appeal of the fragment as Schiller left it: a hybrid of philosophical inquiry and suspenseful illusion."
"Ronnie Shields is an American football player known for lining up at tight end, and he has spent time seeking opportunities at the professional level. Born in Los Angeles to Ron and Victoria Shields, he later moved to Georgia and attended Stephenson High School in Stone Mountain, finishing in 2010. Notably, he was a late starter in the sport, only taking up football during his junior year of high school, yet he developed enough to attract college interest.

Shields committed to the University of Kentucky in late 2009 and arrived on campus in the summer of 2010. He remained with the Wildcats program through 2014, building his experience at the collegiate level in a competitive conference.

After college, Shields entered the 2015 NFL Draft but was not selected. He worked to earn a roster spot by attending the Seattle Seahawks’ rookie minicamp that May, though it did not immediately result in a contract. Early in 2016, Seattle signed him to a futures deal, a type of agreement commonly used to bring players into offseason programs. Over the following months, he was waived, brought back, and later released again with an injury designation as roster decisions were made ahead of the season."
"Vzyado was an Argentine post-punk group from Buenos Aires that emerged in 1982 during a period of rapid growth in the city’s independent music circuit. The band became known for a tense, rhythmic sound built on sharp guitar patterns, elastic bass lines, and vocal delivery that shifted between spoken and melodic phrases. Critics often linked their approach to the broader post-punk movement, citing parallels with British and Latin American acts that blended punk energy with funk-inflected grooves and experimental arrangements. Although their initial run was short, Vzyado later returned for a series of reunion performances and releases.

The band formed when bassist Paula Rinaldi and vocalist-guitarist Martín “Tino” Ledesma began collaborating after meeting at small concerts in the San Telmo area. They soon recruited guitarist Federico Sosa, whose interest in angular, percussive playing complemented Rinaldi’s driving bass work, and drummer Javier Paredes, who had previously played in local new wave projects. From the beginning, Vzyado rehearsed and recorded with limited resources, which pushed them toward a stripped-down style emphasizing rhythm and texture over polished production.

Their first full-length record, Grabación en Taller, appeared in 1984 through a small independent imprint that specialized in underground rock. Despite its title suggesting a concert album, it was actually recorded live in a rehearsal space with minimal overdubs. The choice was partly aesthetic, but also practical: studio time was expensive, and the group wanted to capture the intensity of their stage sound. The album circulated widely via tape trading and college radio, helping the band build a reputation beyond Buenos Aires.

In 1985, internal scheduling pressures began to affect the lineup. Sosa increasingly focused on a separate project that was gaining commercial attention, and he departed later that year. As a trio, Vzyado recorded their second album, Entre Sombras, released in 1986. Compared with the debut, it featured more space in the arrangements and a heavier use of repetitive motifs, reflecting the band’s interest in dance rhythms and early industrial textures. Shortly after the album’s release, the group stopped performing. Members later pointed to uneven promotion, financial difficulties, and growing personal responsibilities as key factors in the decision.

Vzyado resurfaced in 2004, with Rinaldi and Ledesma returning alongside a new drummer, Nicolás Albornoz, after Paredes had moved abroad. The reunion led to festival appearances and club dates, and several older tracks were licensed for an international compilation focused on Latin American post-punk. In 2009, the band released a short EP, Rastro, their first new material in over two decades. Activity gradually slowed in the following years, and the project ended after Ledesma’s death in 2016.

Over time, Vzyado came to represent a particular strand of South American post-punk: resourceful, rhythm-centered, and shaped as much by local scenes as by global influences."
"UEFA Group H formed part of the European qualifying programme for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, one of nine groups used to determine which national teams from UEFA would reach the tournament in Russia. The section eventually included six sides: Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Estonia, Cyprus, and Gibraltar. Teams were initially allocated during the preliminary draw held in July 2015 in Saint Petersburg, where UEFA established the group-stage framework and match calendar for the upcoming campaign.

A notable administrative change occurred after the draw. Gibraltar became eligible to take part once it was accepted as a FIFA member in 2016, and it was subsequently placed into Group H. At the same time, UEFA managed political and security considerations connected to Kosovo’s admission by avoiding certain pairings, including keeping Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo apart in the group phase. Because Gibraltar’s inclusion increased the number of participants, the scheduling approach for the group had to be adjusted.

Group H also intersected briefly with planning for the host nation. Russia, already qualified automatically as tournament organisers, had been linked to the original five-team version of the group so that it could play friendly matches on the same international dates as Group H’s “bye” rounds. These friendlies were intended as preparation for Russia and did not influence the qualifying table. When Gibraltar was added and the group expanded to six teams, those spare dates disappeared, and the concept of coordinated friendlies was dropped.

As in other UEFA groups, each team played the others twice, once at home and once away, producing a standard double round-robin format. Results were compiled into a standings table that ranked sides primarily by points, with goal difference and other tie-breakers used when needed. The first-place team earned direct qualification to the World Cup finals. The second-place team’s route was more uncertain: runners-up were compared across groups, and the strongest of them advanced to a play-off round for the remaining European spots.

Belgium finished top of the group and secured automatic qualification. Greece ended the campaign in second position and progressed to the play-offs as one of the best runners-up, but were eliminated over two legs by Croatia, which meant Greece did not reach the finals for the first time since 2006.

The group’s matches produced a high goal total, with Belgium’s attack contributing heavily. Romelu Lukaku led the scoring charts for the group, while several other players—including Eden Hazard, Edin Džeko, and Konstantinos Mitroglou—were among the more frequent scorers. Defensive discipline also shaped squad selection: under UEFA rules, red cards and accumulated yellow cards triggered automatic suspensions, affecting availability for key fixtures and carrying over to the play-offs where applicable."
"Cope is an English-language surname found in many countries, especially in Britain, Ireland, North America, and parts of the former British Empire. Like many family names, it has been carried by people active in a wide range of fields, so it often appears in biographical lists and reference works.

In politics and public service, several individuals named Cope have held office or served in government roles, including members of Parliament and officials connected with British administration. The name also appears in legal and judicial contexts through judges and other civic figures. In addition, certain Cope families have been associated with local influence and long-standing involvement in regional affairs, which is why genealogical sources sometimes discuss “Cope” as more than just a single person’s surname.

The arts provide another visible group of bearers of the name. Cope has been used by poets, musicians, actors, and visual artists, spanning different periods and styles. In literature and performance, it may be encountered both as a birth surname and as a professional name.

Science and scholarship form a further category. People named Cope have contributed to disciplines such as chemistry, medicine, anatomy, classical studies, and economic research, with some becoming well known through published work or academic posts. Sports and broadcasting also include multiple Copes, from football and cricket to motor racing and rugby, as well as commentators and media personalities.

Because the surname is shared by many unrelated individuals, reference pages often provide a “see also” section linking to similar spellings or related disambiguation entries."
"Revenue can be artificially boosted when a company pushes more merchandise into its distribution network than the network can realistically sell to end customers. This tactic is commonly called channel stuffing, and it usually involves offering distributors or retailers unusually large shipments near the end of a quarter or year. On paper, those shipments may be recorded as “sales,” even though the products are still sitting in warehouses or on store shelves and may later be returned or heavily discounted.

The motivations vary. Senior management may be trying to meet earnings expectations, stabilize a stock price, or satisfy lenders’ performance requirements. In other cases, the pressure comes from within the sales organization: aggressive quotas and short reporting periods can encourage sales teams to prioritize immediate volume over sustainable demand. When incentives reward shipments rather than sell-through, the system can drift toward oversupplying the channel.

The longer-term impacts are often harmful. Excess inventory tends to boomerang back to the manufacturer through returns, buybacks, or special concessions. Holding and handling those unsold goods raises logistics costs and can clog warehouses. Production planning also becomes less reliable: factories may ramp up to support a surge in shipments, only to face a sudden lull in orders afterward, leading to overtime, idle capacity, or abrupt schedule changes.

Pricing can suffer as well. To persuade partners to take unwanted stock, companies frequently use steep discounts, extended payment terms, or marketing allowances. These incentives reduce margins and can distort market pricing. When too much product is floating around, it may leak into unauthorized resale channels, undermining official distributors and confusing customers about legitimate pricing.

Large retailers sometimes recognize the pattern and exploit it. By delaying routine purchases until a supplier’s reporting deadline, they can negotiate more favorable terms when the supplier is eager to “hit the number.” The next period may then start with minimal orders as the retailer works down inventory, perpetuating a cycle of spikes and slumps.

Because channel stuffing can mislead investors about true demand, regulators and auditors may scrutinize it, particularly when revenue recognition rules are stretched or when it accompanies other accounting concerns."
"Hawton is a village and civil parish in the western part of the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, close to the county boundary with North Yorkshire. The parish includes the neighbouring settlements of Elden and Carrfield, and in recent decades has maintained a population of a little over four thousand residents. Its northern edge follows a small river valley, while a long-established coaching route and later main road defines much of the boundary to the west. The surrounding landscape is largely flat, with wide fields, drainage ditches, and scattered woods that reflect centuries of agricultural use.

Very little is documented about Hawton before the late 11th century, when places in this region first appeared in national surveys of landholding and taxation. At that time the community would have been small, with most households tied to farming and seasonal labour. In the medieval period, a larger neighbouring village developed religious and commercial importance, gaining a church and regular trading opportunities, while Hawton remained a quieter agricultural hamlet. Local legend connects nearby woodland to outlaw stories that circulated across Yorkshire, but firm evidence for those links is limited and tends to belong more to folklore than to record.

A small religious house was later founded close to the river, taking advantage of access to water and fertile ground. Like many minor priories, it never became wealthy or politically prominent, and its buildings were eventually removed during the suppression of monastic institutions in the 16th century. Over time, the land was absorbed into private estates, and control of the manor changed hands several times. In the 18th century a notable benefactor left money for local poor relief and assigned parts of the estate to an educational foundation, an arrangement that influenced rents, repairs, and the management of parish land for generations. A substantial manor residence was constructed during this period, symbolising the estate’s authority and providing employment for local craftsmen.

Through the 19th century Hawton continued to depend on farming, but its social life expanded. Inns and beerhouses appeared along the main road to cater for travellers and labourers, and a school and chapel were added as literacy and nonconformist worship grew in the countryside. The arrival of the railway in the mid-1800s changed the village’s connections even if it did not immediately transform its economy. A small station on a branch line allowed quicker movement of people, livestock, and produce to nearby market towns.

Early in the 20th century, proposed coal mining in the wider area encouraged speculative building. Rows of red-brick terraces were erected in anticipation of new workers, and when pits opened within travelling distance, additional services—especially a larger public house—were established. After the Second World War, further housing estates gradually filled gaps between older cottages, and several historic farm buildings and the manor house were demolished, replaced by modern developments.

Today Hawton functions mainly as a residential village for commuters travelling to Doncaster, Pontefract, and other nearby centres. It retains a small selection of amenities, typically including a shop, social club, and a couple of pubs. Much of its older architectural character has been reduced, though a small number of listed features—such as a historic pump or milestone—still provide visible links to the parish’s long rural past."
"William, Willie, or Billy Dunn is a name shared by a wide range of people in public life, and it can refer to individuals in politics, sports, the military, academia, and the arts. Because the surname Dunn is common in the United Kingdom, Ireland, North America, and other English-speaking regions, lists of “William Dunn” often collect notable figures from different centuries and professions.

In politics and public service, several William Dunns have held elected office or civic leadership roles. Some were members of national legislatures in Britain or the United States, while others served in local government as mayors or municipal officials. A number of men named Sir William Dunn also appear in historical records, reflecting British titles such as baronetcies that were passed through families.

Sports is another area where the name appears frequently. Football (soccer) records include multiple players called William or Billy Dunn from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, some associated with well-known clubs in Britain. Other athletes include golfers—where “Willie Dunn” may refer to both players and course designers—as well as competitors in Olympic or international events in disciplines such as bobsleigh. In some cases, the same sport contains more than one notable Dunn, so birth years or team affiliations are used to distinguish them.

Beyond politics and sport, the name is linked to varied careers: industrialists involved in agriculture or milling, military figures recognized for wartime service, physicians connected to professional medical institutions, and academics working in fields such as international relations or biochemistry. The entertainment and cultural sphere includes performers and writers, and in Canada the name is also associated with a musician and filmmaker who engaged in activism and public debate.

Related entries often point readers to broader resources, such as pages for “Bill Dunn,” the general Dunn surname, or similarly spelled names like Donne."
"In Mende religious tradition from Sierra Leone, Ngewo is regarded as the highest creator deity and ruler of the sky. Accounts describe this supreme being as the source of the world’s existence and the power that governs major forces of nature, such as weather and other events that shape life on earth. Some explanations also note that ideas about Ngewo developed through the joining of earlier divine figures: a male creator associated with the name Ngewo and an older female divinity, Leve. In this combined understanding, Leve is often treated as Ngewo’s partner, while worship centers on the single, overarching name.

Ngewo is frequently characterized as remote. Rather than being involved in everyday problems, he is seen as dwelling above and remaining beyond ordinary human reach. Even so, stories suggest that neglect has consequences. People who fail to honor the creator through prayer or tribute may be corrected or punished, not because Ngewo is constantly present, but because proper respect is viewed as maintaining balance between humans and the divine order.

Communication between Ngewo and the community is often described as indirect. Ancestor spirits, commonly called dyinyinga, function as intermediaries who can carry concerns upward and deliver guidance downward. These spirits may also require offerings, especially food, reflecting the idea that the living and the dead remain linked through ritual exchange.

Several myths explain key features of human life. One narrative tells of a time when Ngewo lived alone on earth and, seeking companionship, made animals in pairs before shaping the first man and woman. Another tale accounts for mortality: two animals were sent with opposing messages about human destiny, but the bearer of death arrived first, fixing death as part of the human condition."
"TriBeCa, sometimes written as Tribeca, was an American drama anthology that premiered in 1993 on the Fox network. Developed by producer David J. Burke and made in association with TriBeCa Productions, the project also involved Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal in a producing capacity. Each installment told a self-contained story, using the TriBeCa area of lower Manhattan as a shared backdrop rather than following a single continuing plot. The program’s opening music was “Keep It Going,” performed by the alternative hip hop artist Me Phi Me.

The series became known for recruiting high-profile talent both in front of and behind the camera. Alongside regular performers such as Philip Bosco and Joe Morton, episodes featured a wide range of guest actors, including Eli Wallach, Kevin Spacey, Kathleen Quinlan, Carol Kane, Debbie Harry, and Danny Aiello III. Notable musicians also appeared, among them jazz legend Dizzy Gillespie. Creative duties were similarly varied, with scripts and direction handled by Burke and additional filmmakers and writers such as Hans Tobeason, John Mankiewicz, Barry Primus, Bryan Spicer, and Jeffrey Solomon.

Critical response highlighted the show’s ambition and the caliber of its participants. Laurence Fishburne earned a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his lead performance in the opening episode, “The Box,” where he played Martin McHenry. Even with strong reviews and award recognition, the series struggled to build an audience and was cancelled after seven episodes, concluding its only season in 1993."
"The Dark Side of Nowhere is a middle-grade science fiction novel by American author Neal Shusterman. Released in 1997 by Little, Brown and Company, the book is about 256 pages long and is often recommended for readers around age twelve and older. It blends familiar school-and-family settings with unsettling mystery, using a small town to explore questions about identity and belonging.

The story centers on Jason Miller, a teenager who begins the day feeling as though something is off. The problem is not simply mood or stress; his sense of self seems to have shifted, and the world around him no longer fits the life he remembers. After a sudden tragedy involving his friend Ethan, Jason notices that people in his community behave in odd, almost staged ways. Conversations feel rehearsed, reactions seem delayed, and even those closest to him appear to be hiding information. As Jason tries to understand what has changed, he becomes increasingly suspicious of the town’s routines and the “normal” life he once wanted.

As the plot develops, Jason is pushed into a transformation that forces him to confront what the town really is and what role he has been assigned within it. The novel uses science fiction elements to raise broader ideas about conformity, the pressure to fit in, and how a desire for an exciting life can lead to unexpected consequences.

The book has been recognized on several youth reading lists and award programs, including state-level selections and honors from library and young adult literature organizations in the late 1990s and early 2000s."
"Punk in Drublic is the fifth studio album by American punk band NOFX, issued in 1994 through Epitaph Records. Arriving after the group had already built a strong underground following, the record helped push 1990s skate punk into wider visibility. It keeps the band’s fast, abrasive approach, but it also adds more melodic hooks and tighter song structures than many of their earlier releases. Lyrically, the album mixes sarcasm, social commentary, and personal frustration, often delivered with humor that contrasts with the speed and intensity of the music.

The album’s title is a playful twist on the phrase “drunk in public,” hinting at recurring themes of substance use and misbehavior without presenting them in a celebratory way. Musically, the songs are built around quick tempo changes, choppy guitar rhythms, and busy drumming. Short tracks dominate the running time, giving the record a relentless pace, but several songs slow down just enough to highlight NOFX’s knack for melody.

Release and promotion for Punk in Drublic came at a moment when independent labels were gaining attention as punk and alternative rock reached larger audiences. The record benefited from extensive touring and word-of-mouth support in skate and college scenes. Over time it became one of Epitaph’s best-known releases and a frequent entry point for new listeners exploring 1990s punk.

Critical and fan reception has often focused on the album’s blend of technical playing and accessible choruses. Many listeners cite it as a benchmark for skate punk production in the mid-1990s: loud and energetic, but clearer and more balanced than many DIY recordings from the era. The album is also commonly referenced in discussions of punk’s shift toward broader popularity during the decade, even though NOFX remained outside the major-label system.

Track highlights include “Linoleum,” “Leave It Alone,” and “The Brews,” all of which became staples in live sets. The record’s lasting presence is also tied to its distinct sense of humor, which influenced later pop-punk and skate-punk bands looking to combine sharp commentary with catchy songwriting.

The lineup at the time featured Fat Mike on bass and vocals, El Hefe on guitar and trumpet, Eric Melvin on guitar, and Erik “Smelly” Sandin on drums. Together, they produced an album that captures a specific moment in punk history while remaining a widely recognized example of the genre’s sound."
"The 1969 Texas A&I Javelinas football squad represented the Texas College of Arts and Industries—today Texas A&M University–Kingsville—during the 1969 NAIA season. Competing in the Lone Star Conference, the Javelinas were led by long-time head coach Gil Steinke, who was in his 16th season guiding the program. Texas A&I produced an outstanding year, finishing 11–1 overall and 6–1 in conference play. That performance earned the team a share of the Lone Star Conference title, and it capped the season by winning the NAIA national championship after a victory in the Champion Bowl. The campaign included only one defeat.

The roster drew significant recognition from conference coaches when the All–Lone Star Conference teams were announced. Fourteen Javelinas received first- or second-team selections, reflecting strength across both offense and defense. Among the first-team honorees were defensive backs Alvin Matthews and Ed Scott, along with standouts on the line and at linebacker, including Don Hynds, Curtiss Neal, Margarito Guerrero, and Robert Young. On offense, James Respondek and linemen such as Andy Browder and Ronald Fielding were also placed on the top unit. Second-team selections included quarterback Karl Douglas, running back Henry Glenn, receiver Dwight Harrison, and center Tom Domel, among others.

Several players gained attention beyond the conference level as well. Matthews and Guerrero were named to the Associated Press Little All-America second team, while Young earned third-team recognition and Scott received honorable mention. The Javelinas played their home games at Javelina Stadium in Kingsville, Texas."
"The so‑called Tomb of Eve is a former burial landmark once found in Jeddah on Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea coast. Locally it was often referred to as Eve’s Grave, and popular tradition linked it to Hawwa (Eve), who in Islamic and wider Abrahamic lore is regarded as the first woman. Although no archaeological proof confirms the identification, the site became a point of curiosity for residents and travelers and, at times, a destination for visitors seeking blessing.

Descriptions of the location appear in early twentieth‑century accounts by diplomats and writers. One British consular report from 1926 provides a rare administrative reference to the monument, while other observers mention its unusual proportions. Estimates varied, but several authors described a very long, narrow tomb outline, far larger than an ordinary grave. This exaggerated scale encouraged debate: some treated it as symbolic, while others used it as evidence that the claim could not be literal.

The tomb also intersected with the city’s name and folklore. Jeddah is commonly glossed as “grandmother” in Arabic, and this meaning supported the popular idea of Eve as an ancestral figure connected to the area, even if the linguistic explanation is disputed among scholars.

Religious and political authorities eventually restricted the site. Attempts to remove or reduce the monument were reported in the late Ottoman period, and it was ultimately dismantled under Prince Faisal in 1928. Later, in 1975, remaining traces were covered with concrete to discourage devotional practices at graves, which many clerics viewed as improper. Today, the Tomb of Eve survives mainly through historical references and the continuing interest it generates in discussions of Jeddah’s heritage."
"Erica Jasmin Mena (born November 8, 1987) is an American reality television figure who first built public recognition through modeling work and appearances in hip hop music videos. Over time, she expanded into television and publishing, becoming a familiar face within the Love & Hip Hop franchise.

Mena’s early career was rooted in the entertainment and fashion worlds, where she worked as a model and gained attention as a “video vixen.” This label is commonly used for women featured prominently in music videos, particularly in the hip hop and R&B genres. During this period, she appeared in videos connected to well-known recording artists, which helped her develop name recognition beyond traditional modeling.

Her profile grew further when she transitioned to reality television. She appeared on shows that followed the personal and professional lives of cast members, a format that often blends behind-the-scenes access with scripted structure. Mena became best known for her role on Love & Hip Hop: New York, the first series in a long-running franchise focused on relationships and careers within the hip hop industry. She later joined Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta and also returned to Love & Hip Hop: New York for a milestone season. In addition, she participated in VH1’s Scared Famous, a competition series that combines celebrity casting with horror-themed challenges.

Outside television, Mena has also pursued writing. She released autobiographical books that present her personal experiences and public image through a confessional style, reflecting on relationships, self-perception, and life in entertainment.

In her personal life, Mena has publicly identified as bisexual and has spoken about her Latina heritage, with Puerto Rican and Dominican family roots. She attended Newburgh Free Academy in Newburgh, New York. She is a mother of three children. Her first child, a son born in 2007, is with music video director and rapper Raul Conde, associated with Fat Joe’s Terror Squad. Mena was previously engaged to performer Bow Wow. She later became engaged to rapper and TV personality Safaree Samuels in 2018; the couple married in 2019 and welcomed a daughter in 2020 and a son in 2021. In 2021, reports indicated that Mena filed for divorce from Samuels."
"Ditte Hansen (born 6 December 1970 in Copenhagen) is a Danish performer and writer recognized for combining acting with scripted comedy and satire. She is especially associated with the television series *Ditte & Louise*, which later expanded into a feature film, and with her work in Denmark’s long-running revue tradition.

Hansen grew up in Copenhagen in a difficult home environment marked by her father’s alcoholism. Episodes of instability and mistreatment left lasting effects, and she has spoken about seeking professional support at times to manage the impact of those experiences. In adulthood, she has described having a strong personal support system, including her relationship with her spouse.

Her professional training began at the Odense Theatre’s acting school, from which she graduated in 1996. Soon after, she worked at the theatre for several years, gaining stage experience that later informed her screen roles. She entered Danish film with a part in Hella Joof’s comedy-drama *Oh Happy Day*, and later became a familiar face in popular entertainment, including the annual *Cirkusrevyen*, where performers present sketches, songs, and political humor.

Alongside acting, Hansen has taken on high-profile hosting work within the Danish theatre world, including presenting the Reumert awards in 2010 and again in 2011. On television she has appeared in both dramatic and comedic formats, including a role as a forensic pathologist in the third season of *Forbrydelsen* (*The Killing*), as well as multiple characters in satirical programming on DR1.

From 2015 to 2018 she co-wrote and starred in *Ditte & Louise* with Louise Mieritz, producing two seasons and a film adaptation. In 2019, she added book publication to her credits with *Gode Kasser*."
"The 2014 edition of the Campeonato Alagoano marked the 84th running of Alagoas’s main professional football championship. Matches were played from 12 January through 30 April, with Coruripe finishing the season as champions and lifting the state title for the third time in their history. At the opposite end of the table, Penedense and Comercial-AL ended the campaign in the relegation positions.

The tournament was organized in stages. In the opening phase, eight clubs competed in a home-and-away round-robin schedule. After all teams had faced each other twice, the four best-placed sides advanced to knockout rounds, and the stage winner earned a place in the following year’s Copa do Brasil.

A second phase then expanded the field, adding CRB and CSA, who had been involved in the 2014 Copa do Nordeste. Ten teams were divided into two groups, playing for spots in the decisive rounds. The leading teams from each group progressed to semifinals and a final. This stage also distributed national berths: the top teams qualified for the next Copa do Brasil and Copa do Nordeste, while the best overall performer secured a place in the 2014 Série D of the Brazilian Championship.

One notable change before kickoff was the merger involving Corinthians Alagoano and Santa Rita, which opened a promotion place for Penedense."
"Benalto is a small settlement in central Alberta, Canada, administered by Red Deer County. It lies a short distance west of the Town of Sylvan Lake and is considered part of the region’s rural network of communities. For statistical reporting, Statistics Canada identifies Benalto as a “designated place,” a category used to present census data for populated areas that are not incorporated as municipalities.

Immediately beside Benalto is Kountry Meadows, a manufactured home community that is also treated as a separate designated place by Statistics Canada. While the two areas are closely connected in daily life, the official hamlet boundary for Benalto does not currently extend to include the manufactured home park.

Population figures for Benalto are reported through the national census program. In the 2016 Census, Benalto had 177 residents living in 63 of 66 private dwellings, a slight increase compared with 175 people in 2011. Census tables also provide measures such as land area and population density, which help describe how concentrated the population is across the settlement’s footprint. Updated counts and dwelling totals are released in each new census cycle, including the 2021 Census of Population."
"Édouard-Montpetit station is part of the Montreal Metro system in the borough of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Quebec. Managed by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM), it serves the Blue Line and sits near the base of Mount Royal, close to major educational and medical institutions. Because the station is built into the mountainside, it is notable for its depth and its distinctive underground cavern layout.

The station uses side platforms for trains in each direction. Passenger circulation is organized around several access points: a principal entrance along boulevard Édouard-Montpetit connects directly to the fare-paid area, while additional entrances link the station to nearby streets and to pedestrian routes leading toward the university sector. Internal corridors and stairways guide riders between the ticketing level, the platforms, and connecting passageways.

As with many stations in Montreal’s network, public art is integrated into the architecture. Decorative elements and wall treatments are placed in prominent areas such as the mezzanine and along pedestrian links, reinforcing the station’s identity and providing visual reference points for passengers. Digital information displays are also installed to provide service notices, the time of upcoming trains, and other transit announcements.

The station’s name reflects its location on Édouard-Montpetit Boulevard, a key east–west corridor that borders the campus area. It functions as an important transfer point between the metro and local bus routes, making it a practical gateway for students, staff, and visitors traveling to the Université de Montréal, nearby colleges, and hospital facilities."
"The Primetime Emmy Award once included a category recognizing art direction for single-camera television series. Presented as part of the Creative Arts Emmy Awards, it honored the teams responsible for the visual look of a show’s environments, including sets, scenic treatments, and the overall design approach that supports storytelling. Over the decades, the name and scope of the prize shifted to reflect changes in television production and how the Academy grouped similar work.

In earlier years, the category appeared under broader titles that combined art direction with scenic design. Later, it was reshaped into awards that separated series and program types, such as dramatic productions versus other formats. By the late 1990s and into the 2000s, the single-camera focus became a defining feature, highlighting series that relied on carefully constructed locations and sets rather than multi-camera stage layouts.

In 2014, this award structure was retired and replaced by a set of production design categories organized by narrative format and length. The revised system distinguished between contemporary or fantasy narratives running an hour or more, half-hour narrative programs, and period narratives of one hour or longer. This change aimed to better compare similar kinds of productions, since a historical drama and a modern-day series often face very different design challenges.

Across its history and successor categories, certain programs accumulated multiple wins and frequent nominations, reflecting sustained recognition for consistent visual world-building. Notable repeat award recipients included period dramas and large-scale fantasy series known for detailed sets and distinctive environments. Other long-running shows earned numerous nominations, indicating steady excellence even when they did not win.

The category’s timeline spans from its mid-1950s origins through its discontinuation in 2013, after which production design awards continued under the updated classifications."
"The Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother are a Roman Catholic congregation of Franciscan religious women that began in the late nineteenth century and became closely associated with caring for the sick and vulnerable. Established in Rome in 1883, the group developed during a period when many new religious communities were formed to address social needs created by urban poverty, migration, and limited access to medical services.

The origins of the congregation are connected to Father Francis Mary of the Cross Jordan, who was organizing what would later be known as the Society of the Divine Savior, or Salvatorians. Seeking a women’s branch to share in this mission, he invited Amalia Streitel, a German woman with experience in religious life and education, to come to Italy and help form a new community. After arriving in Rome, she received a new religious name, Mother Frances of the Cross, and began gathering women who wanted to combine prayer with practical works of mercy.

Early conditions were modest. Housing was sparse and resources were limited, yet the small community responded to immediate local needs by taking in children without guardians and providing basic care within their own living space. As the group grew, questions arose about governance and the direction of the new institute. Within a few years, the sisters and the Salvatorians separated, and the community came under diocesan oversight in Rome. At this stage they adopted a Franciscan-inspired way of life shaped by the Rule of the Third Order Regular of Saint Francis, balancing contemplative practice with active service.

To sustain themselves and fund their charitable work, the sisters pursued practical ministries. They offered nursing services in private homes and carried out duties connected with church life, including work in a sacristy at a Roman church associated with the German-speaking community. Over time, healthcare became a central focus, both as a response to social need and as a stable form of service that matched their charism.

A significant expansion occurred when Mother Frances of the Cross traveled to the United States at the request of a bishop in Kansas to assist a struggling hospital. This initiative led to additional foundations, including hospital work in the Midwest, later developments in New Jersey, and a mission presence farther south. In 1911, the congregation received formal papal approval, marking its establishment within the wider structure of the Church.

Today, the Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother continue their mission in multiple countries across Europe, the Americas, and parts of Africa and the Caribbean, with ministries that often remain linked to healthcare and pastoral service."
"Karl August Theodor Lenz (12 February 1881 – 17 October 1952) was a German dramatist, lyric poet, and prose writer whose career bridged the late imperial era and the turbulent decades that followed. He was born in Bromberg, in the Prussian Province of Posen (today Bydgoszcz, Poland), and later studied literature and philosophy before turning to writing and theater administration.

Lenz published early volumes of poetry and a series of short novels that explored moral conflict, religious doubt, and social change in rapidly modernizing cities. Among his better-known titles are the novella collection Schatten am Fluss (1906) and the novel Die fremde Stunde (1912). He also wrote stage works, including the historical drama Herzogin Clara (1914) and the symbolic play Der Spiegelgarten (1920), which were staged in several German-speaking theaters.

In addition to his literary output, Lenz held influential cultural posts. During the 1920s he served as an artistic adviser at a municipal theater and later worked in radio, helping develop spoken-word programming and adaptations for early broadcasting. Like many cultural figures of his generation, he faced professional setbacks after 1933, when political pressure limited his public roles and curtailed productions of his work. After the Second World War he returned to publishing, contributing essays on theater practice and the responsibilities of writers in public life. He died in southern Germany, leaving a body of work that reflects both aesthetic experimentation and the constraints of his historical moment."
"Varghese Kuriakose (14 February 1901 – 3 September 1972), often remembered locally as the “Pastor of Puthenpadi,” was a Syro-Malabar Catholic priest from Kerala who became known for combining pastoral work with community development. Serving in a largely rural region where poverty and poor access to services were common, he emphasized practical assistance alongside religious instruction. In later years, his reputation for personal discipline and public service led to the opening of an ecclesiastical inquiry into his life, a preliminary step used by the Church when evaluating a person’s virtues.

Kuriakose was born in 1901 in a farming family in the Alappuzha area to Mathew and Annamma. His early education took place in local government schools, after which he continued studies at a church-run college noted for training students for public examinations. He entered seminary formation in Thrissur, where he completed philosophy and theology and was ordained a priest in the mid-1920s. Those who knew him during training described him as methodical and attentive to the everyday concerns of ordinary families.

His first significant appointment came in the early 1930s, when he was sent to Puthenpadi, a parish spread across small hamlets with limited roads and few institutions. He prioritized building stable parish structures, but his efforts were not limited to church construction. Under his leadership, the community established a primary school that later expanded to include classes for girls, a small hostel for children without reliable caregivers, and a cooperative initiative that helped families obtain seeds and basic supplies at fair prices. He also encouraged preventive health practices and arranged periodic medical visits until a permanent dispensary could be organized.

Accounts of his ministry often highlight his habit of visiting households regardless of social background and mediating local disputes without taking sides. Supporters attribute to him several favors received through prayer, which are collected as testimonies during Church investigations. A diocesan tribunal later assembled written records, witness statements, and archival material to evaluate the consistency of these reports and the broader impact of his work. Regional media and parish publications have periodically featured programs and articles revisiting his legacy and the institutions that grew from his initiatives."
"SkyRidge Aviation was a small Italian firm associated with the paragliding industry, known for producing paraglider wings and emergency reserve parachutes. It operated from the outskirts of Trento, after an earlier period in nearby Rovereto. Available records suggest the company was active by the early 2000s and ceased trading around 2009, during a period when several niche aviation brands struggled with rising certification costs and a tightening retail market.

The business was part of a broader holding structure called SkyRidge Sport Group, led by entrepreneur Carlo Venturi, which later appears to have dissolved. Day-to-day product development at SkyRidge Aviation was overseen by designer Luca Ferretti, who had previously worked with established canopy makers in the Alps and brought experience in pattern design, line layouts, and fabric selection. Although administrative functions remained in Italy, much of the sewing and assembly was carried out in a partner facility in Tunisia that had been set up specifically for technical textile work. This arrangement allowed the company to scale production while keeping development and testing close to European mountain sites.

SkyRidge offered a range intended to cover typical pilot progression. Entry-level wings emphasized predictable inflation and strong passive safety, while intermediate designs targeted efficient thermal climbing and better glide. At the top end, the company produced higher-performance wings for experienced pilots, along with a tandem model used by instructors and commercial operators. Product literature frequently highlighted durability, consistent trim speed, and careful quality control of stitching and line measurements.

In 2004 a prototype from the series, the Kestrel, was evaluated during a comparative demo week near Lake Garda. A reviewer noted particularly steady behavior in active air and a coherent feel on brake input, which helped build the brand’s visibility outside Italy. Near the end of its existence, SkyRidge focused on achieving European EN ratings across multiple sizes for one of its mid-level models, while an advanced wing was reportedly undergoing certification trials.

Competition participation was limited but measurable: several SkyRidge models appeared in international cross-country events and a handful of World Cup tasks during the decade, usually flown by independent pilots rather than factory teams. Known wing names associated with the company include Arco, Brio, Cirrus, Kestrel, Mira, Nova, Sirocco, and the dual-seat Duo."
"Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul is a documentary released in 2005 and directed by German-Turkish filmmaker Fatih Akın. The film explores Istanbul through its music, using performances and street-level encounters to show how the city’s cultural identity is shaped by many communities and traditions. Rather than focusing on a single genre, it moves across styles that coexist in contemporary Istanbul, including arabesque, rock, hip-hop, electronic music, and folk-influenced sounds.

A central figure in the documentary is Alexander Hacke, a German musician known for his work with the experimental band Einstürzende Neubauten. Hacke serves as a guide and narrator, traveling through neighborhoods, clubs, rehearsal rooms, and informal gathering places. He and Akın record musicians in varied settings, emphasizing how music emerges from everyday urban life as much as from formal stages. This approach highlights the city’s layered character, where local traditions meet global influences and older forms continue to evolve alongside newer ones.

The film received international attention and was screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 2005 outside the main competition lineup. Its soundtrack reflects the documentary’s wide range of featured artists, presenting both well-known performers and more underground acts. By placing these musicians side by side, the film suggests that Istanbul’s sound cannot be reduced to a single narrative; it is built from contrasts, collaborations, and ongoing change.

Often categorized as a music documentary as well as a portrait of Istanbul, the film is also noted for its multilingual and cross-cultural perspective. It connects German and Turkish viewpoints while documenting a city that functions as a bridge between regions, histories, and musical languages."

"Ronald Aspinall (26 October 1918 – 16 August 1999) was an English cricketer who represented Yorkshire and later worked as a first-class umpire. He was born in Almondbury, near Huddersfield in West Yorkshire, and developed a reputation as a dependable lower-order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler.

Aspinall’s first-class opportunities arrived relatively late. He was 27 when he debuted for Yorkshire in 1946, in the period immediately after the Second World War when county sides were rebuilding their squads. Despite a short top-level career, he produced several performances that drew attention. One standout match came in 1947 against Northamptonshire, where he dominated with the ball across both innings and played a central role in a decisive Yorkshire win.

By 1948 he was appearing more often, taking on responsibilities at the head of the attack and sharing the new ball with fellow Yorkshire bowlers. He also featured in the celebrated match against the touring Australian side of 1948, commonly associated with Don Bradman’s unbeaten team. In that fixture, Aspinall managed the notable achievement of dismissing Bradman in the second innings, along with other key Australian players.

His final season at the highest level began impressively. In early 1949 he recorded excellent bowling figures and briefly led England’s national bowling averages, taking wickets at a very low cost. However, a serious Achilles tendon injury brought his first-class playing days to an abrupt end.

After leaving county cricket, Aspinall continued in the game through Minor Counties cricket with Durham during the 1950s. From 1960 to 1981 he served as a first-class umpire, extending his involvement in professional cricket for more than two decades. He died in Almondbury in 1999 at the age of 80."
"Romano’s Macaroni Grill is a casual dining restaurant brand known for Italian-American dishes served in a sit-down setting. The chain operates dozens of locations across the United States and maintains corporate offices in Denver, Colorado. Its concept blends familiar American restaurant service with menu items inspired by Italian and broader Mediterranean cooking traditions.

The first Romano’s Macaroni Grill opened in 1988 in Leon Springs, Texas, an area that is now part of San Antonio. The restaurant was created by Philip J. Romano, a restaurateur whose name became closely associated with the brand’s identity. Over time, the original site changed hands and later ceased operations after a fire in 2021, leaving its future uncertain.

The company’s ownership history includes several major transactions. In 1989, Brinker International acquired franchise rights and expanded the concept significantly. By the mid-2000s, Brinker began evaluating strategic alternatives for its large portfolio of company-run restaurants. In 2008, a controlling share of the chain was purchased by Mac Acquisition LLC, tied to Golden Gate Capital, while Brinker retained a smaller minority stake for a period afterward. Another change occurred in 2013, when Ignite Restaurant Group bought the brand in an all-cash deal. Two years later, ownership shifted again when Redrock Partners acquired the business at a much lower reported price, reflecting the challenges many mid-market restaurant chains face as consumer preferences and competition evolve. In 2017, Romano’s Macaroni Grill entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a process often used by restaurant companies to restructure leases and debt while continuing to operate. In 2018, the company expanded its portfolio by purchasing Sullivan’s Steakhouse.

Macaroni Grill’s menu centers on pasta, sauces, and classic Italian-American combinations. A signature offering is a build-your-own pasta option, allowing diners to select noodles, sauce styles, and add-ons such as proteins or vegetables. Meals commonly include complimentary bread served with olive oil, aligning with familiar Italian restaurant customs in the U.S. The brand has also promoted ingredient sourcing from Italy, highlighting relationships with family-run suppliers to emphasize authenticity and traceability.

Beyond dine-in service, Macaroni Grill has extended its presence into retail through packaged food products modeled on restaurant dishes. These items have been produced through a partnership with a large consumer food manufacturer, making the brand available to customers outside its restaurant locations.

Nutrition has been a recurring topic in the chain’s public profile. In the late 2000s, media coverage criticized the high calorie counts typical of many full-service restaurant meals. Later reporting noted improvements, pointing to menu revisions and leadership initiatives aimed at reducing calories in certain entrées and presenting lighter options."
"Dark Days is the first full-length studio release by the American rock project Loaded. The album was put together in Seattle, Washington, during sessions that ran from late 2000 into early 2001 at Jupiter Studios. After the recording was completed, it initially appeared as an independent release in mid-2001, reaching listeners in the United States and Japan first. A wider European release followed the next year, helping the record find an audience beyond its original market.

The album’s background is closely connected to earlier songwriting efforts by frontman Duff McKagan. As the sessions took shape, he revisited several pieces that had been associated with his previous work and reworked them alongside newly written material. For the studio lineup, McKagan assembled musicians drawn from Seattle’s broader rock scene. Drummer Geoff Reading joined the project after playing in bands such as Green Apple Quick Step and New American Shame, while guitarist Dave Dederer came in with experience from The Presidents of the United States of America. Producer Martin Feveyear played a central role in shaping the sound and also contributed keyboard parts, giving certain tracks added texture beyond the core guitar-bass-drum setup.

McKagan handled bass throughout the record and also contributed additional instruments where needed. One notable detail is that he played piano on the song “Misery,” showing a willingness to broaden the album’s palette. Guitarist Mike Squires, known for work with groups including Harvey Danger and The Nevada Bachelors, was invited to add extra guitar layers, reinforcing the album’s dense, riff-driven approach.

Before release, McKagan confirmed the title Dark Days and chose to present the material under the band name Loaded rather than as a solo effort, signaling a more collaborative identity. Promotion for the album included a short run of club shows, including dates at House of Blues venues in several U.S. cities. As touring plans expanded, the lineup was adjusted to support live performances, adding players so McKagan could shift between roles onstage. Tours in the United States, Japan, and later Europe helped maintain momentum into 2002.

Years later, the album was reissued in 2008 on both CD and digital formats, with certain editions including bonus live recordings from the band’s Japan tour, offering a snapshot of how the songs evolved in concert."
"Berseba is an electoral constituency located in Namibia’s ǁKaras Region, with the village of Berseba serving as its administrative centre. The area includes notable natural and populated sites, such as the Brukkaros crater and small settlements including Snyfontein, Helmeringhausen, Tses, Bethanie, and Goageb. At one point the constituency recorded about 6,659 registered voters. Census figures show steady growth over time: the population rose from 9,064 in 2001 to 10,589 in 2011.

The constituency is also linked to early resource exploration in Namibia. Diamonds were first identified in this broader area in 1898, and petroleum discoveries followed in 1929, highlighting the region’s long-standing connection to mining and prospecting activity.

Political representation has changed over successive regional elections. In 2010, SWAPO candidate Dawid Boois won the council seat with 1,225 votes, ahead of several opponents from parties such as the RDP, DTA, DP, and COD. He retained the position in 2015 after increasing his vote total to 1,774. In 2020, the seat shifted to the Landless People’s Movement when Jeremias Gooieman secured 1,822 votes, while SWAPO’s Steve Sensus Ovambo finished second with 1,127."
"Parker Memorial Night is a live jazz release credited to Chicago-based multi-instrumentalist Ira Sullivan, documenting a concert performance from the early 1960s. The session was taped at a benefit-style tribute honoring alto saxophonist Charlie Parker, a central figure in the development of bebop. The recording first appeared on the Vee-Jay label as a single LP, capturing a compact set built around Parker-associated repertoire and a few well-known standards. Decades later, the album was expanded and reissued on CD, adding previously unissued selections from the same event and turning the original program into a longer snapshot of the band’s book.

Critical discussion of the reissue has often highlighted the value of the expanded track list. Reviewers note that the additional performances broaden the view of the ensemble, moving from fast bebop heads to mid-tempo blues and ballad material. The core appeal is the spontaneity of the live setting: extended solos, audible interaction between horns and rhythm section, and the way familiar themes are reshaped through improvisation.

The repertoire centers on Charlie Parker compositions, alongside tunes by writers closely connected to modern jazz and the American songbook. The expanded edition also includes pieces associated with Dizzy Gillespie and other contemporaries, reflecting the wider bebop ecosystem rather than a narrow “greatest hits” approach.

Sullivan is featured primarily on trumpet and flugelhorn, supported by a quintet with tenor saxophone, piano, bass, and drums. The personnel underscores a typical bebop frontline and rhythm section, emphasizing tight unison themes, brisk tempos, and a harmonic language rooted in rapid chord changes and melodic variation."
"In the early decades of motorized transport, lawmakers in several places adopted so-called “red flag” requirements for road vehicles. These rules were designed to reduce collisions and prevent horses and pedestrians from being startled by unfamiliar machines. At a time when roads were shared by walkers, carts, and livestock, even a slow-moving automobile or steam carriage could create panic, and governments treated it as a public safety issue that needed special regulation.

In Britain, a series of statutes known as the Locomotive Acts placed strict limits on the use of mechanically powered vehicles on public roads. The best-known measure, passed in the mid-1860s, required a small crew rather than a single driver and demanded that one person walk ahead of the vehicle to provide advance warning. That escort was expected to signal to other road users and to help manage encounters with horse-drawn traffic. The distance between the walker and the vehicle was set far enough to give riders and drivers time to react, and the warning could be given with a clearly visible flag by day or a lamp in low light. These restrictions reflected widespread concern that heavy, noisy machines would endanger the public and disrupt everyday travel.

A similar approach briefly appeared in the United States. In the 1890s, Vermont adopted a law aimed at steam-powered road vehicles, requiring a person to proceed ahead of the machine and alert those traveling with animals. Night travel brought an additional expectation: a red light or other clear signal to increase visibility. The rules generally focused on road-going vehicles and did not cover railways, which already operated under separate safety systems and dedicated rights-of-way.

Red flag provisions did not last long in most places. As engines improved and vehicles became more reliable and controllable, governments shifted toward other forms of regulation, such as speed limits, licensing, standardized lighting, and traffic enforcement. The brief era of red flag laws illustrates a transitional period in transport history, when societies were adapting legal frameworks to technologies that were rapidly changing how roads were used."
"“The Novocaine Mutiny” is a fourth-season episode of the television comedy-drama *M*A*S*H*, first broadcast in early 1976. The story is framed around a formal military inquiry, using the structure of a hearing to revisit a chaotic day in the 4077th’s operating room. Rather than unfolding in a straightforward timeline, the episode relies on testimony from different characters, allowing the audience to compare competing versions of the same event and to see how personal agendas can shape “official” narratives.

The plot centers on Captain Hawkeye Pierce, who is accused of mutiny by Major Frank Burns. The accusation is serious: under military law, mutiny can carry extreme penalties, and the threat of a court-martial hangs over Hawkeye from the outset. To decide whether the case merits a full trial, a preliminary proceeding is convened, presided over by a superior officer brought in to evaluate the evidence.

Much of the background to the charge stems from a brief period when Colonel Potter is away from camp. In his absence, Burns takes on acting command and attempts to impose strict discipline. His efforts are less about operational necessity than about control, and they disrupt the unit’s usual routines. One example is a campaign against gambling, which Burns treats as a major breach of order. When a large sum of money goes missing, he launches a broad and intrusive search across the camp, refusing to accept the more mundane explanation that the money was simply lost during a card game. The investigation becomes increasingly petty and personal, creating tension among staff who are already stretched thin by the demands of the war.

During the hearing, witnesses describe the lead-up to the operating-room confrontation. Their accounts emphasize the pressures of mass casualties, limited time, and the need for careful triage and preparation before surgery. Hawkeye’s defense rests on a professional argument: he believes Burns was pushing patients into surgery without adequate pre-operative assessment, increasing the risk of preventable deaths. Burns, by contrast, portrays himself as the only one trying to keep the unit functioning under impossible conditions, casting Hawkeye as insubordinate and reckless.

The central incident is presented in sharply different ways. Burns claims he was deliberately incapacitated so that Hawkeye could seize control. Hawkeye describes a more mundane sequence in which Burns is removed from the operating room after his decisions endanger patients, and an accidental injury contributes to Burns being knocked out. The hearing officer ultimately concludes that the evidence does not justify escalating the matter to a court-martial, treating Burns’s account with skepticism.

After the proceedings, life at the 4077th returns to its familiar rhythm. The episode closes by highlighting the gap between rigid rule-making and the informal culture that keeps the unit functioning, suggesting that survival in a field hospital often depends as much on practicality and trust as on strict adherence to authority."
"Antoine Wehenkel (10 February 1910 – 27 February 1992) was a Luxembourg politician with a professional background in engineering. He played a prominent role in the Luxembourg Socialist Workers’ Party (LSAP), serving as its president from 1970 to 1974. His parliamentary career began in 1951, when he entered the Chamber of Deputies, where he remained a central figure in national politics for more than two decades.

During the 1960s, Wehenkel moved from legislative work into government. In the cabinet led by Pierre Werner, he held responsibility for public finances as Minister for the Budget. He also took charge of economic policy in a period when Luxembourg was modernizing its industrial base and expanding energy planning, including in a ministry that combined national economy and energy matters. After a change in coalition in 1969 pushed the LSAP out of government, Wehenkel returned to parliamentary leadership rather than executive office.

He later became President of the Chamber of Deputies, a position that involves overseeing debates, maintaining procedural order, and representing the legislature externally. He held this post until 1974, when he left national politics. Alongside his national roles, he also served on the municipal council of Luxembourg City from 1951 to 1964."
"“Never Again” is a phrase best known as a moral commitment to prevent the return of genocide and mass persecution. It is closely linked to remembrance of the Holocaust, but it has also been adopted in discussions of other atrocities and human rights crises. Over time, the words have moved beyond their historical origins and become a widely used title and theme across many kinds of media and public life.

In film and television, “Never Again” appears as the name of multiple productions from different eras. Early cinema includes silent-era shorts and features that used the title for stories unrelated to modern political meanings. Later works include an independent film released in the early 2000s, as well as episodes of popular television series. When used in episodic TV, the phrase typically signals a turning point, a personal vow, or a confrontation with past trauma, even when the plot is not directly about historical genocide.

The phrase is also common in publishing. Several nonfiction books employ it to frame accounts of the Holocaust or to argue for vigilance against hatred and state violence. Other titles apply “Never Again” to national security, justice policy, or the interpretation of political periods after major conflicts. In addition, some authors use the wording for alternate-history or speculative series, where the title suggests an attempt to rewrite outcomes or prevent catastrophic events in imagined timelines. Across these works, the phrase functions as a warning, a lesson drawn from history, or a call to collective responsibility.

Music has likewise embraced “Never Again” as an album title, an EP name, and a recurring song title. Artists across rock, metal, pop, and electronic styles have used it to express regret, resolve, protest, or recovery. Because the phrase is short and emphatic, it lends itself to lyrics about breaking destructive cycles—whether in relationships, personal behavior, or broader social conditions.

Beyond entertainment and publishing, “Never Again” appears in the names of advocacy groups and public initiatives. Organizations and campaigns using the phrase often focus on fighting racism and antisemitism, promoting human rights, or responding to contemporary threats such as political discrimination or gun violence. Related expressions—such as “Lest We Forget,” “Never Forget,” and equivalents in other languages—are often grouped with “Never Again” because they share an emphasis on memory, accountability, and prevention."
"Secret House Against the World is a full-length studio release by Canadian hip hop artist Buck 65. Issued in 2005 through WEA, the record stands out for blending rap with elements drawn from indie rock, electronic music, and left-field pop. Several guest musicians and producers contribute to its sound, including members of Tortoise, as well as Gonzales, turntablist D-Styles, and songwriter Tim Rutili. Their involvement helps give the album a wider palette than a typical boom-bap production, with arrangements that shift between sparse beats, layered instrumentation, and more melodic passages.

Reviews from professional critics were broadly positive, though not unanimously so. On Metacritic, which aggregates published ratings into a single weighted score, the album landed in the low 70s from a modest set of reviews, a range generally associated with favorable reception. Some writers highlighted the variety of structures and textures across the track list, arguing that the constant changes keep the project engaging. Others focused on Buck 65’s delivery, noting that he sounds more comfortable matching his voice to rootsy or unconventional backdrops than on earlier releases. A few dissenting reviews described the album as challenging and emotionally distant, suggesting it may be best suited to listeners who enjoy experimental approaches to hip hop."
"Boneland, published in 2012, is a novel by Alan Garner that continues the story begun in his earlier books set around Alderley Edge in Cheshire. The central character is Colin, once a boy in the previous tales and now an adult who keeps to himself in a small, prefabricated shelter perched in an old quarry. Although he remains close to the landscape that shaped his childhood, his life has taken a more scientific direction: he works as an academic connected with the nearby radio astronomy facilities at Jodrell Bank.

Colin’s present is defined by a striking gap in memory. He cannot recall anything from before early adolescence, which leaves large portions of his identity inaccessible, including family connections and the extraordinary events suggested by the earlier novels. To address this, he attends psychotherapy. Much of the narrative follows the slow, often uncomfortable process of recovery, showing how fragments of recollection can surface through conversation, association, and emotional pressure rather than through simple logical deduction.

Running alongside Colin’s modern story is a second thread set in deep prehistory in the same region. A solitary person living in a cave landscape sets out from a rocky chasm to seek contact and belonging. The two storylines echo each other across time, linking personal memory with the older, shared patterns of myth and place. Garner has described his interest in the motif of the “sleeping hero,” and the book also draws meaning from an ancient stone hand axe, a tool that acts as both archaeological object and symbolic bridge between eras."
"The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Sorocaba is a Latin-rite ecclesiastical jurisdiction headquartered in Sorocaba, in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. It serves as a center of pastoral administration for parishes, clergy formation, and Catholic institutions in its territory, and it also leads an ecclesiastical province made up of neighboring dioceses.

The local church began on 4 July 1924, when Sorocaba was separated from surrounding jurisdictions and erected as the Diocese of Sorocaba. This reorganization reflected population growth and the need for more direct oversight of communities in the region. Decades later, on 29 April 1992, the diocese was elevated to the rank of metropolitan archdiocese, giving it additional responsibilities toward the dioceses placed under its province.

Leadership has passed through several bishops and archbishops. In the period as an archdiocese, the ordinary has been Archbishop Júlio Endi Akamine, S.A.C., in office since 28 December 2016, preceded by Archbishop Eduardo Benes de Sales Rodrigues (2005–2016) and Archbishop José Lambert Filho, C.S.S. (1992–2005). Earlier, as a diocese, it was governed by Bishop José Carlos de Aguirre (1924–1973), followed by Bishop José Melhado Campos (1973–1981) and then Bishop José Lambert Filho (1981–1992).

The archdiocese has also included coadjutor and auxiliary bishops who later received assignments elsewhere, and some priests from Sorocaba have been appointed bishops in other Brazilian dioceses. Its suffragan dioceses include Itapetininga, Itapeva, Jundiaí, and Registro."
"A toy soldier is a small model figure designed to resemble a military soldier. While many people think of painted plastic or metal figurines used in children’s play or in collectible displays, the phrase “toy soldier” also appears as a title or theme across a range of cultural works.

In literature, the term has been used for both poetry and fiction. It can serve as a straightforward reference to the miniature figures themselves, but it is also often employed as a metaphor for duty, conformity, or the loss of individuality. Some novels and other written works use “toy soldiers” to evoke controlled behavior or to comment on war from a domestic, everyday perspective.

Film and television have adopted the phrase in multiple ways. It has been used for action stories involving hostage situations, for dramatic narratives focused on conflict and resilience, and for documentary projects exploring real events or social issues. Individual television episodes in different series have also carried “toy soldier” as an episode title, typically to suggest characters being manipulated by larger forces or placed into rigid roles.

The name is also prominent in gaming. “Toy Soldiers” has been used for action-strategy titles that blend playful miniature aesthetics with battlefield mechanics, sometimes expanding into sequels and follow-up releases. These games often treat warfare as a tabletop-like scenario, using stylized units and accessible controls while still incorporating tactical decision-making.

In music, “Toy Soldier(s)” appears as the name of performing groups as well as the title of songs spanning pop, rock, and hip-hop. Songwriters frequently use the image to explore themes such as emotional vulnerability, being controlled by someone else, or the tension between innocence and conflict.

Related titles sometimes reference similar concepts using other terms for animated figures or miniature fighters, reinforcing the enduring appeal of the toy-soldier image in entertainment and art."
"Hank Jones, Ray Brown, and drummer Jimmie Smith teamed up in 1976 to record a straight-ahead jazz trio date for Concord Jazz that later appeared under the alternate title *Rockin’ in Rhythm*. Built around familiar standards, the session highlights the group’s shared sense of time and their conversational approach to melody and accompaniment. A notable feature is Jones’s decision to alternate instruments: on several tracks he moves from acoustic piano to electric piano, changing the color of the ensemble without altering its small-group format.

Critical response to the album has been mixed but generally appreciative. Reviewers often point to the trio’s tight coordination and the clarity of Jones’s phrasing, while noting that the electric piano brings a different character to his playing. Some commentary has singled out performances such as “Bags’ Groove” and “Spring Is Here” as especially effective examples of the trio’s balance between swing, restraint, and blues feeling. Other assessments have been less enthusiastic about parts of the repertoire, suggesting that the song choices are uneven compared with other releases Jones made in the same era.

The track list includes “Your Feet’s Too Big,” “My Ship,” “Alone Together,” and the Ellington-associated “Rockin’ in Rhythm,” with Jones, Brown, and Smith comprising the full personnel."
"Power Machines is a Russian manufacturer of equipment for the electric power industry, formed in 2000 and based in Saint Petersburg. The company specializes in large-scale machinery used in power generation, with a product range that includes steam turbines, turbine generators, and related components. Its steam turbine designs cover high-capacity units that can be applied in conventional thermal stations as well as in nuclear energy, where reliability and long service life are critical requirements. In addition to supplying domestic projects, the firm has participated in deliveries to dozens of foreign markets, and its export activity has been especially noticeable in parts of Asia.

The modern company was assembled by bringing together several long-established enterprises and design organizations in the Russian power-engineering sector. This structure reflects the way heavy electrical machinery is typically produced: different plants focus on castings and metalworking, generator manufacturing, blade production, control and testing, and engineering services. By combining these capabilities under one corporate umbrella, the company is able to develop equipment, manufacture key assemblies, and support installation and maintenance through the full life cycle of a power unit.

Changes in ownership were an important part of its early history. After the company’s creation, a controlling stake was held through an investment vehicle linked to a major Russian industrial shareholder, while a significant minority stake belonged to an international engineering group. Several years later, the foreign partner exited by selling its shares, and the company subsequently left the Russian stock exchange. A later mandatory buyout offer to remaining minority shareholders prompted public criticism from an investor advocacy organization, followed by a regulatory review and an administrative fine related to the offer process.

Power Machines’ portfolio includes different classes of turbines and turbine-generator sets, as well as gas-turbine and combined-cycle solutions developed in-house or produced under licensing arrangements. In practical terms, this means the company can supply equipment for various plant configurations, from standalone steam turbine units to modern installations that pair gas and steam turbines to improve efficiency. Alongside manufacturing, it also provides engineering support, modernization services, and spare parts—functions that are essential for utilities operating large power stations over multiple decades."
"Amar Dedić (born 18 August 2002) is a Bosnian professional footballer who operates mainly as a right-back. He is contracted to Red Bull Salzburg and has gained regular top-flight experience in Austria, including a loan spell with Wolfsberger AC. Dedić has also been involved with Bosnia and Herzegovina’s youth national teams, most notably at under-21 level.

Dedić’s development began in local football in Austria before he entered structured academy environments. He played for LUV Graz as a child and later joined Sturm Graz’s youth program in 2012, where he continued his training during his early teenage years. In 2015, he moved to the Red Bull Salzburg academy, a pathway known for promoting young players into professional football through its affiliated clubs.

His transition to the senior game started in 2019, when he signed his first professional terms with Salzburg. He then featured for FC Liefering, Salzburg’s feeder team competing in Austria’s second tier, which is commonly used to provide competitive minutes to emerging talents. Dedić made his senior debut in July 2019 and scored his first goal at professional level the following summer. His progress led to an extension of his Salzburg contract and opportunities in cup competition with the first team.

To accelerate his experience at the highest domestic level, Salzburg arranged a season-long loan to Wolfsberger AC in 2021. The move allowed him to play more consistently in the Austrian Bundesliga and continue his development in a demanding tactical environment.

Internationally, Dedić has represented Bosnia and Herzegovina across several youth categories and has worn the captain’s armband at under-17 level, reflecting his status within his age group."
"Jeremiah Antonio Lewis (March 2, 1987 – August 14, 2019), professionally known as J-Lex, was an American hip-hop artist associated with the Southern rap scene. He gained his widest recognition with the 2016 track “Run It Up,” which entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 92. Lewis was killed in a shooting in 2019.

Lewis was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and spent much of his childhood in the region before relocating to Dallas as a teenager. He frequently cited local bounce music along with mainstream rap influences such as OutKast, Lil Wayne, and The Notorious B.I.G. as shaping his approach to rhythm and storytelling. Friends and collaborators described him as focused on melodic hooks and concise, street-level narratives.

Using the name J-Lex, he began releasing mixtapes online in the early 2010s and built a following through regional radio play and live shows. His growing profile led to attention from established Southern performers and, eventually, a distribution agreement with a major label imprint in 2016. That same year, “Run It Up” became his breakthrough single, earning streaming traction and modest chart success. Music publications highlighted him as an emerging voice, and he made televised appearances performing the song to promote an accompanying mixtape.

On August 14, 2019, Lewis was shot outside a late-night diner in Baton Rouge and died at the scene at age 32. His death prompted tributes from fellow musicians and renewed interest in his recorded work."
"The Hapa–Bilaspur Superfast Express is a long-distance passenger train in India that links Hapa in Gujarat with Bilaspur Junction in Chhattisgarh. It is operated by the Western Railway and runs once a week in each direction under train numbers 22939 and 22940.

In terms of performance, the service covers a distance of about 1,692 kilometres. The Hapa to Bilaspur journey typically takes just over 30 hours, with an average speed close to the mid-50 km/h range. The return trip from Bilaspur to Hapa is of similar duration, with minor differences due to operational factors and scheduled stops.

The train uses conventional ICF coaches designed for a maximum speed of around 110 km/h. Its rake generally includes a mix of air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned accommodation, such as AC 2-tier and AC 3-tier coaches, sleeper class coaches, and general unreserved coaches. A combined seating-and-luggage coach arrangement is also provided to handle parcels and passenger baggage.

Traction changes along the route are a notable operational feature. A diesel locomotive typically hauls the train from Hapa to Ahmedabad. Beyond Ahmedabad, an electric locomotive takes over for the remaining run to Bilaspur, with the same pattern followed in the opposite direction.

The rake is also used for other services when not assigned to this train, helping optimize coach utilization across the network."
"Stampede is a black-and-white American Western released in 1949 under the direction of Lesley Selander. The film features Rod Cameron, Gale Storm, Johnny Mack Brown, and Don Castle in leading roles, with a supporting cast that includes Steve Clark, Donald Curtis, and John Miljan. Set in Arizona ranch country, the story revolves around land, water rights, and the uneasy arrival of new settlers.

The central characters are brothers Mike and Tim McCall, owners of a sizable cattle operation. To profit from unused acreage, they sell part of their range to families hoping to start farms. However, once the newcomers reach the property, they discover that the promised land lacks reliable water. The McCall ranch has blocked the local river with a dam, effectively keeping control of the area’s main supply.

John Dawson, one of the settlers, turns to the county sheriff, Aaron Ball, seeking help. The sheriff’s response is cautious and limited, reflecting the power the ranchers hold and the difficulty of enforcing a fair settlement. As tensions increase, Tim McCall grows closer to Dawson’s daughter, Connie, adding a personal conflict to the larger dispute.

With legal options failing, some settlers consider direct action, including sabotaging the dam. Retaliation threatens to escalate into violence, with plans aimed at driving the McCall herd into a destructive stampede. Like many Westerns of its era, the film uses romance and confrontation to explore authority, resources, and frontier justice."
"WKLF (1260 AM) is an AM radio station that airs a soft oldies music lineup by relaying programming from its sister outlet, WBRI, based in a nearby regional hub. Licensed to the town of Fairview, New York, the station targets listeners across the Riverbend area and surrounding rural communities. The facility is operated by Northfield Media Group, which also owns several signals in the region.

### Early years on 1260 AM
The 1260 frequency first became a local voice in 1961, when it signed on as WFRV with a general-interest, middle-of-the-road sound that mixed popular music, community announcements, and regular news updates. For a period, the station’s offices were housed in a downtown hotel, a common arrangement for smaller-market broadcasters that relied on central locations and walk-in access for local advertisers.

In 1967, the station adopted the call letters WLBK, reflecting new ownership and a desire to align with a larger-market station the owners admired. Like many AM outlets at the time, 1260 AM operated with a “daytimer” authorization. That meant broadcasts were limited to daylight hours to prevent interference with distant stations that could travel farther at night due to changes in the atmosphere. Each evening the transmitter went silent and resumed the next morning.

Programming shifted with audience trends. By 1973 the station moved toward a Top 40 approach, emphasizing current hits and upbeat presentation. As FM radio gained dominance for music in the late 1970s, WLBK gradually leaned into adult contemporary, keeping a broader playlist and a calmer on-air style.

### The modern station era
Following a frequency shuffle within the local market, 1260 AM went dark in 1983 and remained off the air for several years. Service returned in 1989 as WKLF, initially launching with country music and local sports coverage. In the late 1990s the station experimented with different identities, including a period when it mirrored an FM partner carrying an adult standards format. When that FM outlet later adjusted its music strategy, WKLF continued with older-leaning programming to serve longtime AM listeners.

A technical rebuild in 2012 temporarily took the station off the air while transmission equipment and an aging tower system were replaced. The upgraded facilities improved reception in outlying parts of the county and reduced interference complaints.

In 2013, WKLF switched from music to a national sports network, reflecting industry-wide interest in live events and talk programming on AM. That run lasted several years. In 2019, the station changed direction again, ending sports to begin a full-time simulcast of WBRI’s soft oldies service, bringing familiar classics and a steady presentation back to 1260 AM."
"Euseby Cleaver (1745–1819) was an Anglican churchman whose career linked England’s academic world with senior leadership in the Church of Ireland. He served first as Bishop of Ferns and Leighlin from 1789 to 1809 and later as Archbishop of Dublin from 1809 until his death, although his final years in office were affected by reports of serious illness.

Cleaver was born in Buckinghamshire into a clerical family. His father, the Reverend William Cleaver, operated a school at Twyford, and this background helped shape his early education. Cleaver attended Westminster School before entering Christ Church, Oxford. There he progressed through several degrees, beginning with a Bachelor of Arts in the late 1760s and later completing advanced theological qualifications that marked him as a well-trained candidate for higher church responsibilities.

Before his move to Ireland, he held parish appointments in England. In the 1770s he became rector at Spofforth in North Yorkshire. Later, with the support of an influential patron connected to his work as a tutor, he received additional livings in West Sussex, including Tillington and Petworth. Such appointments were common at the time and often depended on networks of education and patronage.

Cleaver’s episcopal career included a short period as Bishop of Cork and Ross, followed by his transfer to Ferns and Leighlin. Political unrest in Ireland deeply affected him: during the rebellion of 1798, his residence in Ferns was attacked, and he temporarily sought safety in Wales, within the ecclesiastical sphere of his brother, also a bishop.

He married Catherine Wynne of County Sligo, and they had several children. Through his daughter Caroline’s marriage to Admiral James William King, Cleaver became the grandfather of Catherine Pennefather, later known for evangelical work. Cleaver was also associated with sympathy toward the Irish language, an interest not universal among senior clergy of his era."
"Araucaria humboldtensis, sometimes called Humboldt’s araucaria, is a conifer belonging to the Araucariaceae family. It occurs naturally only in New Caledonia, where it is considered threatened because its remaining stands are small and widely separated. Many individuals grow in isolation rather than in continuous forests, which can limit pollination and reduce the chance that seedlings establish successfully.

This species is strongly tied to ultramafic substrates, especially serpentine-derived soils that often contain elevated concentrations of metals such as nickel and magnesium. Because these metal-rich landscapes are also targeted for extraction, habitat disturbance from mining and associated road building has been an important driver of population decline. Fire, invasive plants, and erosion on exposed slopes can further hinder regeneration after disturbance.

Mature trees can reach roughly 25–35 meters tall. The trunk is typically straight, bearing tiers of evenly spaced branches that radiate outward and then angle upward toward the tips. This architecture creates a striking, layered silhouette. Like other araucarias, it is monoecious: pollen cones and seed cones form on the same tree but in different parts of the crown. Seed cones develop slowly, remaining attached for multiple seasons until the large seeds are fully mature.

Growth is generally slow, and young plants may take years to become established, particularly on thin, rocky soils. However, the species can tolerate strong winds and periodic dry spells once rooted. Because of its symmetrical form and evergreen foliage, it has also been planted in cultivation as a decorative tree in suitable climates."
"Pakistan’s Parliament has maintained a dedicated body to keep the Kashmir dispute on the national agenda and to project Pakistan’s stance in external forums. Commonly referred to as the Parliamentary Special Committee on Kashmir, it is largely made up of experienced members from both houses: the National Assembly and the Senate. Beyond highlighting developments in Kashmir, the committee is also meant to coordinate positions among major political parties so that the issue is presented with continuity rather than shifting with each change of government.

During the 1990s, separate parliamentary committees were constituted at different times to pursue these aims. These panels varied in size and composition, reflecting political circumstances and parliamentary strength in each period. Leadership was typically given to a senior figure with cross-party standing, which helped the committee engage other parties and represent Parliament in public diplomacy. Over the years, notable politicians have chaired these committees, and the post has been treated as significant within Pakistan’s institutional framework.

When parliamentary activity was limited, a parallel arrangement was also used. Under President Pervez Musharraf, a National Kashmir Committee was created to sustain policy attention and public outreach. This reflected the view that Kashmir required ongoing coordination even when the legislature was not fully functioning.

In later years, a larger committee structure was formed with representation from both chambers and, at times, participation by serving ministers, indicating the overlap between parliamentary advocacy and executive policy. The chairperson has generally been accorded the rank and protocol of a federal minister. In recent times, Shehryar Khan Afridi has served as the committee’s chairman."
"Alain Gautier, born on 8 May 1962 in Lorient, is a French sailor recognized for his career in offshore racing. He became widely known after winning the 1992–1993 edition of the Vendée Globe, the solo, non-stop race around the world. This victory placed him among the leading figures of French ocean sailing during a period when the sport was rapidly professionalizing.

Beyond competition, Gautier has played a significant role in team preparation and technical support. In 1989 he created Lanic Sport Development, a structure focused on coaching, logistics, and performance work for offshore projects. Through this organization he has been involved in the development of several campaigns, including providing support to sailors such as Ellen MacArthur in the late 1990s and Isabelle Joschke decades later. His work reflects a broader trend in modern offshore racing, where shore-based expertise—weather analysis, boat optimization, and project management—has become almost as important as time spent at sea.

Gautier also explored the America’s Cup environment. Together with Bertrand Pacé, he helped lead the Aleph Challenge aimed at entering the 34th America’s Cup in 2013. Although the project did not secure sufficient funding to continue, the team did take part in preliminary circuits using one-design AC45 catamarans before eventually stepping back.

Over the years, Gautier’s results across major events have included stage wins and podium finishes in races such as the Solitaire du Figaro, the BOC Challenge, Route du Rhum, and Transat AG2R, as well as involvement in multihull grand prix competition. His career illustrates both the athletic demands of solo ocean racing and the long-term importance of building sustainable support structures around high-level sailing projects."
"Michael Hartley (born 14 February 1972) is a former Canadian track and field jumper best known for his long jump, with additional experience in the high jump and triple jump. Raised in Toronto, he developed as a versatile collegiate athlete and later represented Canada at several major international competitions during the 1990s and early 2000s.

Hartley built much of his reputation in university athletics, earning repeated all-conference and All-American recognition. While studying in the United States, he became noted for competing in multiple jumping disciplines within the same championship season, a demanding combination that requires speed, technical precision, and event-specific strength. His collegiate career included a national title in the long jump and consistent top finishes at NCAA-level meets.

Internationally, Hartley competed for Canada at global events such as the World Championships and appeared at two Summer Olympic Games. He also participated in multi-sport meets including the Commonwealth Games and Pan American Games, where his placements reflected steady competitiveness against deep international fields. Although he did not regularly medal at the senior global level, he was regarded as a reliable team member and a frequent finalist.

Across his career, Hartley’s best performances came in the late 1990s. His personal records included an outdoor long jump of 8.20 metres, a triple jump of 16.70 metres, and a high jump clearance of 2.25 metres, all achieved at major meets in North America. After retiring from competition, he remained connected to athletics through coaching and athlete development initiatives."
"Nepal’s Second Constituent Assembly was a single-chamber national body created to complete the constitution-writing process after the earlier assembly could not deliver a final document. Voters chose its members in the 2013 Constituent Assembly election, with the new body beginning work in early 2014. Its central mandate was to prepare and approve a constitution, while also acting as the country’s lawmaking forum during a politically transitional period. Once Nepal’s constitution was adopted in 2015, the same institution continued its functions as the Legislature-Parliament. Its term concluded in October 2017, shortly before a new parliamentary system took effect through subsequent elections.

At the start of the assembly’s life, procedural steps focused on setting leadership and getting lawmakers formally sworn in so regular business could begin. The first sitting was chaired by the senior-most member, a common parliamentary practice intended to provide a neutral presiding figure until permanent leadership arrangements are settled. In the opening days, hundreds of elected representatives took their oaths, marking the formal start of the assembly’s authority. Major political forces publicly committed themselves to a rapid constitutional timetable, presenting constitution-making as a national priority and a test of political cooperation. The membership was also notable for high turnover, with many representatives serving for the first time, which influenced both expectations and the pace of internal organization.

Forming a government was another immediate challenge. Nepal’s interim constitutional framework encouraged parties to seek broad agreement when selecting a prime minister and assembling a cabinet. The president played a facilitating role by urging parties to choose a head of government within a set period. Negotiations then unfolded among leading parties, with discussions focused on whether to create a consensus-based administration or proceed with a majority government if full participation proved impossible. Agreements were explored on issues such as power-sharing, timelines for local elections, and a one-year goal for constitution completion. While some parties supported a government led by the largest party, others preferred to remain outside the cabinet, arguing that opposition was necessary for oversight or that key political conditions had not been met. When all-party consensus could not be achieved, the leading parties shifted toward building a majority coalition under the relevant constitutional provisions.

The assembly’s work was structured through a committee system designed to divide specialized tasks and provide detailed scrutiny of policy and administration. Committees covered areas such as state administration, public spending oversight, legislation and legal reform, governance monitoring, environmental protection, international relations and labor, and sectoral issues like finance, agriculture, development, industry, and social welfare. Additional mechanisms, including hearings and special committees, supported appointments and oversight. Together, these structures helped the assembly function not only as a constitution-writing body but also as a working parliament during a crucial period in Nepal’s institutional transition."
"William T. Harris (February 3, 1844 – November 22, 1912) was a Union Army soldier who served in the 122nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry during the American Civil War. He enlisted in the summer of 1862 and was assigned as a private to Company D, a unit raised largely from central Illinois communities. Like many volunteers, Harris spent much of his service on garrison duty and in field operations as Union forces pushed deeper into the Gulf region late in the war.

Harris is best remembered for actions recognized with the Medal of Honor. During the Battle of Fort Blakely in Alabama on April 9, 1865, he took part in the assault on Confederate defenses and was credited with seizing an enemy flag under fire. Capturing a battle flag had both symbolic and practical importance: it could weaken an opponent’s morale, disrupt command signaling, and serve as clear evidence of a position being overrun. A number of medals were issued for similar acts at Fort Blakely, reflecting the intensity of the fighting and the prominence of the objective.

After the war, Harris was discharged in mid-1865. He later settled in Kansas, where he died in 1912 and was buried in a local cemetery."
"David W. Blight (born 1949) is an American historian and writer known for his work on the Civil War era, the struggle over national memory, and the history of slavery and emancipation. His scholarship has helped shape how general readers and students understand the long aftermath of the war, especially the ways Americans debated what the conflict meant and how it should be remembered.

Blight was born in Flint, Michigan, and grew up in a working-class family. He completed undergraduate study at Michigan State University, then pursued graduate training in history at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he earned his doctorate. After teaching appointments early in his career, he joined Yale University, where he became a professor of American history and developed courses on the Civil War and Reconstruction. In addition to classroom teaching, he has often contributed to public history through lectures, interviews, and documentary projects, aiming to connect academic research to broader civic conversations.

A central theme in Blight’s work is the idea that historical events do not end when the fighting stops; instead, societies continue to contest their meaning for generations. He is particularly associated with the study of “memory,” a field that examines how monuments, anniversaries, schoolbooks, and political speeches shape public understanding of the past. Blight has argued that reconciliation between white Northerners and white Southerners after the Civil War often came at the expense of Black rights and a frank reckoning with slavery’s legacy. This approach links political history to cultural history, showing how narratives about heroism and unity can obscure the experiences of formerly enslaved people.

Among his most widely discussed books is *Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory* (2001), which traces competing postwar interpretations of the conflict and explains how certain stories became dominant in national culture. The book received major recognition, including the Bancroft Prize. Blight has also written *Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom* (2018), a large-scale biography that draws on decades of research into abolitionist politics, Black intellectual life, and the changing meaning of citizenship in the nineteenth century. That biography won the Pulitzer Prize for History and was praised for presenting Douglass as both a moral critic and a strategic political actor.

Blight’s published work includes edited volumes and essay collections as well, reflecting his interest in bringing primary sources and scholarly debates to a wider audience. Across his career, he has remained focused on how the United States narrates its own past—and how those narratives influence contemporary struggles over race, rights, and national identity."
"Martín Gabriel Soria (born 7 August 1979 in Rosario, Argentina) is an Argentine tango dancer and instructor known for combining stage experience with detailed teaching. He began studying movement as a child, first through local folk dances and later through tango, which became his main focus during adolescence. By his late teens he was already performing in theater productions in Buenos Aires, where he gained practical experience in choreography, musical interpretation, and partner work.

Soria’s professional visibility grew after appearing as a featured dancer in a late-1990s film project centered on Argentine dance culture. He later worked for several years as an assistant to a prominent tango director, an apprenticeship that shaped his view of tango as a disciplined performing art with a distinct vocabulary rather than only a social dance. Since 2001 he has partnered with dancer and teacher Lucía Ferrer; together they have presented workshops and performances at international tango events.

Their touring schedule has taken them across Europe, North America, and parts of Asia, with frequent invitations to festivals and academies that emphasize both technique and musicality. In 2008 Soria received an honorary recognition from a Buenos Aires tango institution for his contributions as a traveling educator. Along with Ferrer, he developed a stage piece based on the music of Astor Piazzolla and collaborated with other contemporary tango artists on a production that explored modern interpretations of traditional steps.

He has also been interviewed for a documentary about tango pedagogy and performance practice. In recent years, Soria has been based in Berlin, where he teaches regular classes and seminars. In 2012 he and Ferrer helped establish an online program designed to make structured tango training accessible to students worldwide."
"Riverside Trader was one of a small group of British cargo steamers operated by a regional shipping firm that ran regular freight routes between western England and ports in eastern Canada and the United States during the interwar years. Launched soon after the First World War, ships of this type helped rebuild commercial links by carrying mixed cargoes such as manufactured goods, timber, grain, and general stores.

The vessel was constructed in 1921 at a shipyard on the River Avon. Like many merchant ships of the period, she had a steel hull and was powered by a triple-expansion steam engine. This reliable machinery drove a single propeller and provided a modest service speed of about 10 knots, which suited scheduled cargo work rather than fast passenger traffic. The layout typically included several holds, a central engine room, and deck cranes or derricks for loading in ports without modern facilities.

In peacetime, Riverside Trader followed established Atlantic lanes and worked as part of a wider fleet that connected provincial British ports with North American markets. When the Second World War began, merchant shipping was quickly drawn into the conflict. The ship was requisitioned for wartime service, sailed under blackout conditions, and was fitted with basic defensive equipment. After sustaining minor damage during an air raid while berthed in 1941, she returned to duty following repairs.

By 1943, the Battle of the Atlantic had intensified, and slow cargo steamers increasingly traveled in escorted convoys to reduce losses. In early May that year, Riverside Trader joined an outward-bound convoy heading toward Newfoundland. During a night attack by German submarines, she was struck by a torpedo and sank in heavy seas. Several crew members were lost, while survivors were recovered by an escort vessel and later landed safely in St. John’s."
