"Yes, it is somewhat hard to imaging Penelope Ann Miller even considering any type of relationship with Danny DeVito.  And yes, they really do not explore the apparent rift between Peck's character and Miller's.  These two caveats aside, this is a very enjoyable movie.  So all tycoons don't look like Richard Gere.  This is a tour de force for DeVito.  He gets past his diminutive stature and actually becomes Larry the Liquidator.  I was not saddled with having seen (or even heard of) the play.  Theater is irrelevant anyway, except as a training ground for movie actors.  I took this picture on its own merits, and frankly, I was skeptical that DeVito could do a corporate raider.  But he plays it just right and then has you believing that this dwarf from the Bronx really made good.  Dean Jones is convincing as the corporate soldier trying to find a soft place to land. Peck is excellent, as always.Two thumbs up!"
"Maybe not a movie some may expect - from Japan or Kitano for that matter. But that is what makes Kitano so versatile. I first came in contact with him with his violence side/movies. Some of my friends knew him from Takeshis Castle (a TV show that is quite mental). But there is also this dramatic side to him, that is slow and silent (and even philosophical, though that can also be said about his Yakuza movies).So whether you know him or not, may play a role in how you perceive this. He is not leading in front of the camera in this, but he really has the pace down - which as described above is quite slow. Do dreams come true? Can our protagonist juggle his job and his passion (plus love life)? This and more in the adventures of ..."
This was one of a handful of shorts in the Ham and Hattie series done by the UPA studio. There will be mild spoilers ahead: The Ham and Hattie shorts were actually two shorter cartoons paired together and set to music.Sailing is the Hattie short. Hattie plays with a toy sailboat in a fountain while a song about sailing plays over the cartoon. The sailboat gets sunk but a policeman saves the day for Hattie.Village Band is about a band in a small village. They aren't appreciated by their fellow citizens until they suddenly realize that a village band is needed to play for the arrival of a visiting dignitary. The musicians save the day and are then celebrated by the people who basically ignored them before.This short can be found on a three disc box set of Jolly Frolics shorts. The set is excellent and this short is well worth watching. Recommended.
"...And I think that this is what Scary Movie here is trying to prove to us. Many scriptwriters think that by making a character do a stupid decision is going to make the movie a lot scarier, but unfortunately, the movie is usually ruined because of those stupid actions. Take Carmen Electra, at the beginning, for example. Why the hell did she have to take the banana while there was a couple of other weapons that were a lot better, such as a handgun? It just shows a great example to not imitate. The acting was pretty good: The Wayans brothers, Anna Faris and many other were pretty good at imitating mediocre actors. Overall, Scary Movie is a really good choice to look at if you just watched a horror movie and felt really, really disappointed."
"I first saw the French action star in Universal Soldier, and the review for this film said this was his best action thriller film, so I thought why not? Basically Darren McCord (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is a disgraced firefighter, he stopped when a girl he tried to rescue died in his arms. Anyway he has moved on, has two kids, daughter Emily (Whittni Wright) and son Tyler (Ross Malinger), and has taken them to see a Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League play-off ice hockey game, unaware that upstairs the Vice President (Raymond J. Barry) and a few others are being held hostage by money hungry Joshua Foss (Powers Boothe) and his thugs. Soon enough Darren realises the situation when the bad guys start showing up and trying to kill him, and he knows he must save the V.P., as well as his daughter. Also starring Dorian Harewood as Hallmark. Van Damme is certainly better in this than the very slightly silly Universal Soldier, and it is certainly a film not just for his fans, but for all action film fans. Very good!"
"I only watched this movie because I was so impressed with Olivier Martinez in SWAT. But this is no SWAT. SWAT had a plot and some likable characters and made sense. Bullfighter had none of these. I should have realized that it couldn't possibly be any good, after all, the always painfully bad Michelle Forbes had a starring role.One poster here called the movie incoherent. Another called it the worst movie ever. Both gave the movie far too much credit. I am so glad I got it from the library for free, yet I still feel ripped off.IMDb needs to include a ""0"" in the ""rate this film"" vote, just for movies like this one."
"Back in the days of Barbara Walters and Hugh Downs, 20/20 was the best news magazine show on TV. I especially liked their undercover investigations, busting scams and criminals. John F. Stossel did his ""Give Me A Break"" part very well at the time. The older 20/20 shows were the best! And I never missed a show. But ever since Hugh Downs left, the show just hasn't been the same. And now that Barbara Walters has left too, the show has become much of a joke. 20/20 used to be all about protecting the consumer and busting scams and criminals. But now, all they do on 20/20 (besides covering stories that are already all over the news, a lot of which is simply entertainment news) is bust myths. This is sadly, the exact same concept that has also brought down the Discovery Channel. The Discovery Channel used to be all about shows investigating both a lot in science and law, but now all they do is show stupid ""reality"" shows and bust urban myths. I just can't understand all of this, obviously the people in control of these TV networks today are just some really stupid (and lazy) people."
"I was attracted to this film because of Virginie Ledoyen (The Valet, * Women), and to a lesser extent because it was written and directed by Olivier Assayas (Boarding Gate, Demonlover, Paris, je t'aime). I was not thrilled, but I was not terribly disappointed either.Ledoyen, as were all the characters in the film was self-obsessed. Probably none more so than Gabriel (Mathieu Amalric - The Diving Bell and the Butterfly), who seemed to need a constant reaffirmation from his friends, but rejected any criticism of his aimless life.The film revolved around Adrien (François Cluzet), a writer that lived on the margins while composing novels that no one read. In fact, most all of the characters lived on the margins in meaningless jobs. They just floated instead of trying to build something.I guess if I wasn't fascinated with helping someone who seems to live a similar life, I wouldn't have found this film as interesting. But the acting rose above the story and it was, indeed a pleasure to watch."
"Filmfare awards was very cruel that year.this movie only nominated for best actor.but it was its merit to be in the list of nominations for best film,best music director and best lyrics(""Woh To Hai Albela"").i think it was better than the winner of best film ""hum hain rahi pyar ke"".the music of the film was really brilliant specially the songs ""Aana Mere Pyar Ko Na Tum"" and ""Woh To Hai Albela"".i liked the real story of the film and great performance from shahrukh khan.it is a real story and it is the best thing about this film after srk.if srk was not in this film,film was not like this,because Suchitra Krishnamoorthi and Deepak Tijori don't are not special at all.sunil real character and his trying to win his Anna 's heart makes you good feeling.and comedy-romance scenes are so funny. it's not srk's best film or best romance but i think after ""DDLJ"",""Veer Zaara"",""Devdas"" and ""KKHH"" it is his best romantic movie. 10/10.no doubt!"
"Mirror. Mirror (1990) is a flat out lame movie. Why did I watch movies like this when I was younger? Who knows? Maybe I was one for punishing myself by watching one terrible movie after another. I don't know, I guess I needed a hobby during my teen years. A teenage outcast (Rainbow Harvest) seeks solace in an old mirror. Soon she learns about the horrific power this antique mirror has and uses it to strike out against those who have wronged her. Movies like these, the power giver has a nasty side effect. This one changes her inside and out if she likes it or not.A mess of a movie that for some reason was restored on d.v.d. a few years back. I don't know why. They should have left it on the shelf and collect dust. People love this movie foe some reason. If you do I would like to know why. Until then I dislike this movie and I have no reason to ever watch it again.Not recommended at all."
"The Coen brothers flash the based on true story disclaimer for a real 1987 Minnesota incident. It's one of the misdirections. Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) hires two bumbling criminals Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife and force his hard father-in-law Wade Gustafson to pay the ransom. Jerry is miserable working for Wade in his car dealership and he's in desperate need for cash. The kidnapping goes horribly wrong when more people get killed including a police officer. Pregnant sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) goes to investigate.This is a great movie. It has its funny moments. It has great visual touches, the quirky characters, and the off-kilter style that is the hallmark of the Coen brothers. Macy is incredible as the sniffling little weasel. It walks the absurd line between dark and comedy. It has plenty of both. It is simply wonderful."
"i agree with other user comments that this film is *highly* underrated. while i have to admit, i tend to lean toward epics, this is truly one of my favorite movies. whether you care about politics or not, this is a brilliant film about a man who destroys himself because of his own emotional turmoil and inner conflict. All the performances are Oscar caliber (especially Joan Allen as pat Nixon and Mary steenbergen -sic?- as Nixon's mother) and while i've never been a stone fan, i really respect the innovative film-making on this pic. he takes creative chances and ends up with a film that is really different and very watchable. i like 4th of July, JFK, natural born killers and the untouchables okay, but this is by far his best in my opinion."
"This stinker is in mystifyingly frequent rotation on one channel here, and I've found myself watching in horror again and again. The script is like something one would come up with friends over several too many drinks, and the production values match admirably.It's meant to be a children's movie, but features a grotesque (and poorly explained) kidnapping scene; the star dog has a lack of star quality equaled only by the other actors; and it in general has the look of being filmed in someone's backyard (the climactic soccer game features no more than three dozen extras sadly cheering in the background).It even all wraps up with a budget-ran-out voice-over sequence when the story, to one's relief, simply stops. The high-raters here must be either the producers - or the majority of the extras from the soccer game!"
Sometimes older movies either get lower ratings then they deserve or higher ones. This one has much lower one. While not a work of art it is a fun spy comedy. Jeff and Jane Blue have recently had a daughter and are on maternity leave from whatever spy agency they work for and are traveling through pre-Katrina New Orleans where they are hired by their old boss to find and set up circumstance where a female Czechoslovakian arms dealer will leaving willingly and therefor get arrested. All this goes on while they are chased by a couple of cops who are sure Jeff is hiding something after he foils a mugging by Muerte (or Morty) the local wannabe mobster who is also following them trying to get back is lost reputation. It is all quite fun and interesting watching all the players circle around each other.This is a fun comedy worth watching if you can find it. Like alot of older movies that aren't award winning it gets harder and harder to find as each day passes which is a pity. It is fun to watch and nice to see New Orleans before it was hit by Katrina.
"Four cops protecting a prosecutor's witness are all murdered by mob hitwoman Wanda (Kathleen Quinlan) and her team. Prosecutor Daniel Graham (Gabriel Byrne) is infuriated that his case against mob boss Rusty Pirone (Armand Assante) is disappearing. He scrambles to find a new witness. Single mom jury member Valerie Alston (Joanne Whalley) is threatened by ex-cop and mob henchman Tommy Vesey (William Hurt).It's a middling crime drama elevated by a few good actors. It's nothing to get excited about but it's a fine yarn. It starts with Kathleen Quinlan's unusual role. William Hurt gets to be a villain for awhile. Joanne Whalley may be a weak spot. One would hope for a rising star giving a standout performance. All in all, this is a run of the mill middling crime drama."
"THE SHRUNKEN CITY is another straight-to-video children's fantasy flick from producer Charles Band, shot in Romania on the cheap but with lots of high-driving energy to just about see it through. Once again miniaturisation is the subject matter of the movie - Band seemed to be a man obsessed with it - with a couple of kids getting their hands on the titular shrunken city and doing battle with an alien race called the Ood who are determined to destroy it. Much of this is complete nonsense, of course, but the alien costumes are fun in a STAR TREK way and it's nice to see where starlet Agnes Bruckner started out, a decade before THE WOODS and the like. Director Ted Nicolaou is the man best known for helming the SUBSPECIES series of movies."
"Based on a great play and maybe better old movie, this film had promise. A likable cast, a once-skilled writer/director, surely it could work as a romantic comedy, right? WRONG.If there's a lazier, more pleased-with-itself, predictable, trite, non-urgent movie than this, I'd like to know--so I can avoid it too.If you go in expecting the Nora Ephron of WHEN HARRY MET SALLY or SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, you'll be disappointed. This is the Nora Ephron of similarly lame movies MIXED NUTS and MICHAEL.This movie is remarkable in only one way: the product placements for America Online are perhaps the most unrelenting you've ever seen. Do yourself a favor and rent the original SHOP AROUND THE CORNER instead. Back then, Hollywood knew how to make a romantic comedy."
"Cyndi Lauper likes the Skinheads.Even if this was a gang of characters with high moral fiber who would want to hang out with these lunatics?Nice Nazi lampshade... Do creations need lampshades?What a great friend... Moving him from across the stairs to on the cold hard concrete floor.""Thousands of em?""... Clearly it math is not required to join.She was better off with the drug addict.Hando wants revenge for the revenge taken because of him.No water in the bowl?Clearly the police will know who they are.Skinheads falling asleep reading :)That's all you brought?""I surrender""... karma.The problem with being a skinhead is when you want to disguise yourself you can't cut your hair.Almost over... Let's see how they're gonna crash and burn.Hando has no friends left. He's desperate for anyone to keep from being alone."
"This quiet, thoughtful gem of a movie depicts the life of a boy and his family in the north of England in the mid 1950s. It reflects, perhaps, the childhood of the filmmaker, Terence Davies, and the importance that movies can have on one's development. The sounds and images of the film are stunning. They include Nat King Cole's ""Stardust Memories;"" an audio excerpt from ""The Ladykillers"" -- ""Mrs. Wilberforce, I understand you have rooms to let...;"" -- and a lengthy scene consisting of an overhead tracking shot -- kids in school, church, and the cinema. The audio for that scene is the song ""Tammy,"" sung by Debbie Reynolds.""The Long Day Closes"" depicts in a particularly effective and evocative way, the cinema as a place of worship and a source of inspiration."
"Very engaging and erotic drama. Sexual situations and very strong sexual dialogue keep this movie far from dull and moving at a good pace. A sex starved young woman (Sarah Michelle Gellar) makes a twisted bet with her step-brother(Ryan Phillippe). Phillippe is notorious for his sexual conquests. His step-sister bets that he can't bed a devout virgin(Reese Witherspoon) before school starts. The payoff is his Jaguar against doing the horizontal bop with his step-sister.Along the way, Phillippe adds another entry into his journal of conquests, a ditzy child like young woman played by Selma Blair. But the sexploitations come to an abrupt halt when he falls in love with the target of his bet.Also featured in the cast are: Christine Baranski, Swoosie Kurtz and Louis Fletcher."
"This movie is basically nothing but a self referential inside joke. The plot is thin and almost non-existent. You can have the first two things if they are in the background and not the foreground. Unfortunately for this movie this isn't true. The barrage of cameo's looses it's effect after a while. And actually starts to confuse. When an actor shows up I kept asking myself, ""Is that them or are they playing a character?""It was nice to see Tim Robbins playing the lead for once. I don't know if this ended up being explained later since I couldn't make it to the end. I only got about 40 years left and there's a lot of movies out there. But how the hell did she not see him on the phone when he was standing right outside her window? She looks at him several times.I think people like this so much because no one had really made a movie about Hollywood like this before. So it's applauded for it's attempt and not it's success. Movies can be seen as important without being considered good. 2001 also falls in this category. Trailblazing, important movie. Impossible to watch."
"""54"" is a film based on the infamous ""Studio 54"" of the 1970s - the hangout for the social elite and party clubbers. In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character, based on an actual employee of Studio from 1977 - 1982.The film's problem is that it's all glitter and style and no substance. It tries to be a really grimy and probing satire like ""Boogie Nights"" but ultimately comes across as an inferior wannabe. Mike Myers is given the thankless task of playing cocaine-snorting club owner Steve Rubell. It's only a slightly comedic role and if this was Myers' best attempts at sliding into drama like Lemmon and other comedic actors did in their time, it's a total failure.""54"" could have been insightful and interesting but instead it's just another dumb teen flick that isn't entertaining or even remotely engaging. View at your own peril."
"Let me explain. I love films. Toy Story is beyond excellent. Toy Story 3-D is perhaps the biggest con since Keyser Soze convinced the world he didn't exist. There is ONE SCENE in the whole film where you actually get the sense of 3-D and that is right at the end during a snow scene. If you have Toy Story on DVD or have seen it before, stay at home because you are seeing nothing new here. The thing that annoys me is that in addition to paying to see the same film that I own on DVD, I paid extra for 3-D glasses!! unbelievable!! it should've been a highway mans mask and a club. I implore you to stay away from this and Toy Story 2 3-D when it is out as I am sure they will just do the same again."
"Film about filmmaking. It takes place during one day on set of non-budget movie. Ultimate tribute to all independent filmmakers.It should come as no surprise that the director of this film learned the trade under the wing of Jim Jarmusch. The film has a very Jarmusch quality to it, and if it had his name on it I would not have been surprised. Especially the black and white scenes. We also get some great guest stars -- Steve Buscemi, obviously, but also Catherine Keener and Peter Dinklage.Not everyone will like this movie. It is a movie for those who make movies, and for those who love the making of movies. Especially independent films with little or no budget."
"First off, I must say that this is an okay talk show. Also, I haven't seen every episode. However, if you ask me, it's an okay show. I know some of the theme song by heart, too. I don't enjoy every topic that Montel does. Still, I enjoy watching Montel talk about controversial topics. It's especially fun watching people get reformed. That's what I like most about this talk show. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever after it's gone, even though I haven't seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, for all you die-hard fans of this show, if it gets aired in reruns, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good."
"ERMOAspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: MonoWarm, amusing comedy-drama set in northern China where the proud, stubborn Ermo (Alia) works her fingers to the bone selling home-made noodles in order to trounce her snobby neighbors by saving enough money to purchase the biggest TV in the district. Despite this slender framework, the film is rich in characterisation and incident, such as Alia's budding romance with a married man (Liu Peiqi), a narrative thread which is alternately funny and poignant, and genuinely affecting. The acting is restrained and believable, and director Zhou Xiaowen frames and edits every scene to perfection. It's a bit too laidback to really jump off the screen, and its pleasures are minor, but you simply can't fault the craftsmanship on display.(Mandarin dialogue)"
"First off, yes it's slow in a couple parts, and there is some goofy '90s Disney humor, however...The meat of the movie is an excellent coming of age story about taking the next step. Everyone has to let go of their childhoods, but that doesn't mean they have to forget them. This rings especially true for Charlie who has abandonment issues and feels betrayed by Bombay for not being their coach anymore.Anyone who has played peewee sports and moved on to high school or especially a private academy (like in this film) know their tricks that worked then won't work now and the gap is huge. In the end, all you have are your friends, family and teammates, and that's all that matters.Also a side note, this probably has my favorite conversation/speech in any Disney film from Gordon when he talks to Charlie about being the leader he knows he can be. Joshua Jackson carries this movie and sells the character as a confused teenager with great potential. Classic Disney film."
"Sphere was a surprise. I wasn't expecting it to be in my top 10 because of such low ratings on IMDb. A lot of people were disappointed by the ending, but for me, that was the best part. It's full of surprises, you can never guess what's coming next! I've already watched it around 10 times, and I'll make sure that my kids do too or I'll disown them. Although I'm pretty sure that not everyone is going to rate it so highly, but my first viewing experience was amazing and maybe that influenced me to give it such a high rating. (I won't disown my kids, I'll be disappointed) I admit the review is biased, but I love this movie so much!"
"DEATH FLASH is an independent action flick from the mid 1980s that fails to impress very much. The conception and look is heavily modelled on stunt-filled action shows from the era such as THE A-TEAM, but with poor writing and acting throughout, it's hard to enjoy this one. After an opening which feels more like some sappy family drama than anything else, we move into the usual territory where women are kidnapped and the male hero goes single-headedly up against the kidnappers. Some of the stunts are quite impressive here, given that there clearly wasn't a budget for much in the way of special effects, but with nothing to hang them on they're quite meaningless."
"Selena was a young lady trying to fulfill her dreams.She was famous and known for her singing abilities.She married her husband without letting her dad know(He didn't like her boyfriend).She also became a fashion designer..The best part about the movie,was when Selena became a fashion designer.The worst part about the movie,was when Selena got shot and was killed.She was killed by her friend Yolanda.Yoland set Selena up and that's how she shot her. Yolanda got fired because she was stealing from Selena and her father.I guess she got mad and wanted to get back at Selena.That part of the movie left me heartbroken.Overall the movie was good.I really enjoyed it and I would love to watch it again."
"Columbia's Fox & Crow series derives from Frank Tashlin's classic THE FOX AND THE GRAPES and lasted a good half dozen years, and was still available as a comic book in the early 1960s -- it was one of those I turned my nose up at.But the cartoon series, and this one in particular, was a good one. In this one, the neurasthenic Fox is an egg collector, trying to grab a couple of eggs that the Crow has gotten as a couple of war orphans. In an attempt to distract him, the Crow talks the fox into a vaudeville act -- with the usual unhappy consequences for the pair of them.The drawing style is a bit simplified for the series -- not yet at the UPA standards, but definitely trying to save a buck -- but the script is good, the gags are fun and the characters are enjoyable."
"Hey, I know it's cheesy, but it's French cheese! I know I wouldn't be as generous with a Hollywood production of the same quality, but c'mon, they're French, and they're talking much less! This movie shines with the lack of blah-blah typical of le film français--even La Femme Nikita couldn't help turning into a bunch of whining people. The other movie of the late 90's that tried to keep French audiences awake was Dobermann, which was a long nightmare exemplar of a director not knowing when to move on to the next scene. What is great about this movie's plot is that in the end, the speed racer does not resolve to firing guns or hand to hand combat which is typical of most Hollywood productions, but instead uses speed maniac mentality to outsmart the robbers."
"This movie was so funny. It was cheesy, yes. But it was so entertaining. There was really never a dull moment. Any critic that said the movie was bad, is so completely wrong. I would urge everyone to see this movie, you will love it. So please go see it, you will laugh till you are blue in the face. If you think you have ever been in a bad hotel with a lot of crazy people you haven't' seen anything yet. the poor bellhop in this movie went through so much and how he got through it is beyond me. this poor guy went through so much on his first night. seriously, if i ever went through this on my first day of work, i'd probably quit. I was never bored throughout the whole movie, I pretty much laughed through the whole movie. It's best when you watch it with friends,the laughter and sheer unbelievable crap they pull in this movie will just leave you in awe, and laughing a whole lot."
"Never having been a fan of Disney movies I was reluctant to rent this one however my wife was keen and I was somewhat reassured by the rating it had gotten on IMDB! Now I feel somewhat ripped off by my fellow IMDB-ers for misleading me so. This film is horrible and is an insult to a noble Chinese legend. Mulan as a Valley-girl!?! Mushu is nothing but a constant annoyance. The music is alternately bland and inappropriate, the dialogue incongruous, the slapstick un-funny, and the plot transparent. Now I am not a child and did not watch this with a child, but I don't think that it would have improved the experience if I had. Better avoid this one, 5/10"
"Katnip is doing his rounds as a night watchman at ""Stacy's"" department store, when he catches Herman and his gang playing with the toys. Herman hatches a plot to get rid of Katnip by convincing the cat that he is crazy in this good episode in the cartoon series from Famous Studios.Department stores were a natural setting for comedies. Their large assortment of props and different show rooms offered a lot of choices in gags. Even though this cartoon does not offer any new jokes, it offers them capably performed and the extreme physical and facial reactions permitted by cartoons help enliven them here."
"I remember this as a rather odd affair, very male, not particularly woman friendly. A world where blokes are blokey and great, with lovable eccentricities, and women are for ogling - here merely disguised rather than mitigated by romantic pseudo poetic posturing. Rachel Weisz is lovely, but not a real woman, very definitely a male fantasy figure. This felt rather curious, especially when compared with An Evening With Gary Lineker, in which the characters, both male and female, were much better drawn. The attention to detail in the football seemed much better in that other play too, here it seemed rather desultory - a sequence of blokes cheering when goals went in and looking glum when they didn't. To sum up, really rather drippy, almost as wet as Morrissey's mustache as he sipped coffee by the Seine in a ludicrous, introspective setup that a teenager would have been embarrassed to have come up with. Shallow, silly, mooning, wet, not connected to the real world. Check out Lineker - it's much better."
"This is the film that shot Jim Carrey to super-star status in the late 90s. Until he starred in this film, he had been in ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""The Mask"" and ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" to name a few. None of them are quite as funny or entertaining as ""Liar Liar."" It's basically the story of a lawyer who lies quite often, until on his son's birthday, there is a wish made for him to not lie for one day. My, the things that occur! Carrey stars as Fletcher Reede, a defense attorney who wins his cases by having the defendants lie. His life is turned upside down however, after his son's magical wish comes true. He realizes afterward that it is family that matters most, not his work. The film sends a good message to parents about not lying to your children."
This is one of the scariest movie it come out before 1999. It has a great story line. It has great acting. From dusk till dawn 2 Texas blood money is scarier. Still this a very good movie. It has really good special effects. 7.3 is underrating it. I give it 9 out of 10. This is one the scariest vampire stories from 1996. See all From still dawn movies. They are great films. This is an awesome movie. I am running out thing to say. And I need more lines. I like vampires. Think vampires are so cool. This movie is awesome. Great movie great movie great movie great movie. No 7.3 mush better. So cool. You must see this movie is awesome. If this movie does not scary you no movie will. It so cool.
"Cynthia Rothrock is hot, and kicks major ass. That blunt and simple statement doesn't quite clear the way for this D-grade action film.We are talking USA Up-All Night garbage with an extra splash of violence and skin. Speaking of...we glimpse more male skin than female, which hints at a possible homo-eroticism on the director's part. Despite the eye-gouging hook finale, and Cynthia's solid moves, I still can't give this brainless film more than 1 star. For action heads, otherwise beware.The frantic nature and pace of the editing gave me recollections of Umberto Lenzi's or Nicos Mastorakis' style. This may be looking too deeply into a mud puddle, but what can I say? Certainly not a whole hell of allot more. My advice: netflix Enter the Dragon and watch something memorable."
"The Phantom, a man who doesn't die, a legend of the Bengali jungle. A man, who (and his ancestors and his children after him) has sworn to fight against crime his whole life.I was a fan of The Phantom comics, pretty much of the same reasons I was a fan of Tarzan when, I was a kid: They were adventurous and fun and some times thrilling or even little bit spooky. And I actually was surprised when I found out that there was a movie made out of Phantom.Now the good news: movie is set in 1938, which I thought was a good decision. There are even couple of good actors in it: Treat Williams and Catharine Zeta Jones.Bad news: Script is badly written. And actors just seem to sling out their lines without any effort to sound natural. And Treat Williams is actually pretty bad in this film. The Phantom (Billy Zane) is just badly chosen hero for this film.There are couple of good scenes in this film and sometimes even the atmosphere is great, but in over all it's actually nothing very spectacular.Easy to watch ones and forget about it after wards."
"I just got back from seeing Bad Boys 2 and it was the coolest move ever.  It had so much action in it topped off with comedy.  For a 2 and 1/2 hour movie it didn't seem that long at all.  I loved that it didn't have a whole lot CGI effects in it.  I liked how they actually destroyed the cars and how they really blew up that mansion, no fake model stuff.  This was just as cool as the first movie was but a little bit better and cooler.  I don't know how the critics in different areas rated the movie but the ones in my area only gave it 1 and a half stars.  I think it deserves at lease 3 and a half to 4 stars.  I can't what for this movie to hit DVD I be there to get it definitely the first day it hits shelves.  If you haven't go and see this BAD movie."
"I normally hate these action by numbers movies, but for some reason I quite enjoyed this one. It's all done with it's tongue firmly in its cheek with a few one liners that I actually found quite funny. Very well made with some nice effects that wouldn't look out of place in a movie with a lot bigger budget. I would never have seen this movie if it were not for me finding it in a Bargain Bin of DVD's for less than the price of a pack of cigarettes. Glad I did and would recommend to anyone who can get a hold of it cheaply or catch it on TV. Just don't expect a classic!"
"David Mamet is a very interesting and a very un-equal director. His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.This is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated."
"Wow, I am amazed. He actually has some talent. No offense, Keanu. Very rarely do I see a great performance by him. ""The Devil's Advocate"" is a great movie. I was a little surprised that the rating wasn't a little higher. After all, it has a great all star cast that gave their best in the movie. The effects are awesome; and the plot is beyond incredable. Except, I always had an idea that lawyers work for the devil. :D Just kidding! I would recommend this movie to anyone. It has great acting and it's just a kick @ss movie to watch. 9/10"
"This movie is not for everyone; the illiterate and anyone who can't appreciate dialogue that sounds just as dead pan as it should aren't going to understand what's going on here at all. This movie takes a simple relationship, and, in a rather dead pan, witty manner, the characters go through the motions of a long term relationship in about a day. The dialogue is absolutely delicious, and the supporting characters are wonderful. The movie does a magnificent job of dissecting the personality of stereotypical people and relationships. Those who can appreciate the style will be rolling on the floor laughing."
"The creature effects are cool, the story works. The cast works. The characters were likable for the most part, even though there are some character issues in this. It's very funny at points and very scary at points. This movie delivers on both, it's exciting, it's cool, it's just plan great. I don't know what the critics say, but I think the director did a great job. I couldn't wait until they got to the queen monster, in my opinion one cool monster. Plus there is a bit of a mystery, who is the queen monster. A must see if you like alien invasion movies and if you like INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, then you'll love THE FACULTY. I give it...9 STARS"
"I have watched these episodes many times, and I think they are funnier than the original ""Are You Being Served?"" which I love. Don't get me wrong - the original ""Are You Being Served?"" is hilarious. Maybe I have seen them so many times that I am tired of them. The show continues on the premise that was set up in the original series - the retirement fund into which they had all contributed during their time at Grace Brothers. The new cast members are terrific! I only wish they had made more episodes. Fleur Bennett as Mavis is delightful, and Joanne Heywood as Miss Lovelock is terrific. Billy Burden is so funny as Mavis's father, and the setting, the old manor house is beautiful. I would be happy to be a guest at their home!"
"MANNY & LO (2 outta 5 stars)Not a bad movie... just kind of pointless after all is said and done. Two orphaned sisters (one of them pregnant) take the family car and go on the road, trying to keep from getting separated and put into foster homes. Not knowing what to do about the baby on the way, the two young girls kidnap a woman who works in a maternity goods store and hide out in a secluded cabin in the woods. Eventually the three begin to bond emotionally. This would have been a perfect example of a ""nice, family movie"" except for all the profanity spewed by the older sister. The younger sister is played by a young Scarlett Johansson... who I think was a better actress at 12 years old than she is right now. (Oh, I'm just being mean... she's not bad now either.) Mary Kay Place plays the kidnapped baby expert. Aleska Palladino (who?) plays the older sister. Pretty entertaining story... it just tends to get a bit implausible at times."
"Christopher Lambert (Highlander) and Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future) star in this little known comedy as Gus and Bruno two dim witted jewelry thief's who steal the wrong diamond. A comedy of errors and farce ensues as three rival groups battle for the stone.It's gentle comedy that has the occasional chuckle and is well worth a watch as the leads have a good chemistry and Christopher Lloyd gives a very good performance as the quirky older crook. Christopher Lambert shows there is more to him than Highlander and it's a shame he hasn't done more comedies. I enjoyed the film overall but it never rises above average, some of the jokes just aren't funny. But the end set up and payoff makes it worth a look.7/10 - Enjoyable but forgettable."
"This movie is bad. This movie is awful. I was lured in to watching it without doing any research first and was under the illusion that it may in some form be related to Francis Ford Coppola's classic, ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" It isn't. These false pretenses lead to a great deal of disappointment. But as I was watching, it occurred to me that there is one format in which this movie could be improved. That would be if Mystery Science Theater 3000 were to take on this movie as a project and were to work their magic and at least make this over-the-top, cheesy B-grade movie into something that is laughable for reasons other than the predictable dialog and ridiculously melodramatic acting. The highlight of this film comes when the mummy that the story revolves around is being depicted . The camera pans down the arm of the cloth-wrapped creature and when it focuses on the hand, one notices that something doesn't seem quite right. Apparently the special effects and make-up flunkies got together and decided to pull a prank. For some reason, this un-believable depiction of an ancient Egyptian queen has seven fingers on one hand. Curious."
"No film is a 'masterpiece' if it involved physically torturing an obviously distressed cat for 10 minutes,throwing it around like an object, before wrapping it in a net bag and hanging up, then returning with a saucer of milk which is 'supposed' to have rat poison in it, physically forcing it to drink by pressing it's head down then - in the very same shot - standing by while the cat succumbs to unconsciousness, only for the character to be seen walking around with the corpse of the same cat in the next shot.And - get this - this is not just animal cruelty. A child actor of approximately 12-13 years old performs all these acts for the camera. Christ knows what mental effect it had on her.If this film had been made by a western director, critics would be excoriating it and its director. The only thing this 'masterpiece' reveals is that hypocrisy."
"I love the movie Newsies! This is a great movie for the entire family, based on a historical event from the late 1800's. If you love musicals, the dance and singing numbers will definitely pull you in to this movie. My favourite songs are Carrying the Banner, Seize the Day & Santa Fe. But if you don't like musicals, this is an interesting history film too! It illustrates (in a Disneyfied way) something of what it was like to live in New York city over 100 years ago... you get some feel of how hard it was for the poor working class to survive. The topics of child labor & the treatment of orphans are touched on. My niece actually studied this musical in school! It's a good discussion starter. If you don't like history or musicals, you still might like this movie because it is also a story of a poor underdog fighting against the rich oppressor. I find SOME parts of the film slightly boring (the bits with Mr. Pulitzer drag a little), but on the whole, the movie is great. Try this movie!"
"Woody Allen's Shadows and Fog is just play. It's a comic take on German Expressionist filmmaking, like Fritz Lang's M, and other German art, especially Kafka's The Trial. Woody Allen plays a K-like character who is woken up by a lynch mob who want his help in capturing a serial killer, but they never tell him exactly what they want him to do. Mia Farrow plays a circus sword swallower who's fed up with her husband (John Malkovich). The story is kind of random, half of it following Allen, who ends up being suspected of the murders, and the other half following Farrow, who ends up sleeping with a man (John Cusack) for the extravagant sum of $700. The story ends up being disappointing, but it's fun. It's worth a watch. 7/10."
"This ranks among my most favorite of ""Ernest"" movies. The bumbling janitor Ernest P. Worrel (Jim Varney)and his wishy-washy, history-professor friend, Abner Melon (Ron James), stumble upon an old revolutionary-war cannon known as ""Goliath,"" that Abner has been searching for his whole life. Unbeknownst to them, other people are also interested in the cannon because it contains the crown jewels of England: a history professor and Abner's boss, who moonlights as a crime boss, and an British secret agent who wants to recover the jewels for England.As the other reviewer stated, ""Ernest Rides Again"" is a bit more serious in plot, but it is filled with laughs nevertheless, especially in the scenes where Varney plays against straight-man Ron James. Don't miss the hilarious canon ""chase"" scenes! The relative seriousness of the plot makes the laughs that much funnier. Definitely a ""must see,"" especially for those who have never seen an ""Ernest"" movie!"
"This film started out with a gal who had a very boring job as a telephone operator, loved having three some sex and maybe more. All of a sudden, Mimi Rogers,(Sharon)""The Gunman"",'04, desires to seek the Pearl and advance to a higher spiritual level in heaven. Sharon decides to become like a Moses or John the Baptist and go to the desert for the Ending of the World. The Holy Trinity, God, Jesus (Son) and Holy Spirit are her main interests and she becomes converted along with a husband and child. When I first started viewing this film, I thought I must have selected a Holy Rollers documentary, but some of the subject matter was too graphic and the ending of this film is very very much what the Devil would appreciate every human being choosing the path that Sharon finally decided to Take !"
"Five siblings of the Salinger family are left on their own after their parents are killed by a drunk driver. Charlie (Matthew Fox), Bailey (Scott Wolf), Julia (Neve Campbell), Claudia (Lacey Chabert), and little baby Owen struggle both in their every day life and in their emotional life.Never has the stages of grief been so compelling. This is a super angst teen soap that is super addictive. This family just don't have it easy. The cast became well known stars. Other stars include the lovely Jennifer Love Hewitt. It lasted 6 seasons. It's a tough grind to watch all 6 seasons. The depressing story lines grind you down."
"Mon Dieu!  This is a giant, epic drama!  Yes, some of Dantes' disguises are not too believable, but big, beefy Gerard Depardieu is in top form as he battles his way back and dispatches his enemies most satisfyingly.  Scenes filmed on location in Europe are spectacular.  The story moves along briskly, with almost never a dull moment.The supporting players are excellent, and (for those of you who wish to polish up your French) Depardieu's French is clear, concise and not hard to understand.  (The subtitles help, of course!)  DO NOT - repeat - DO NOT buy the dubbed version. Even if you can only say ""merci beaucoup"", listen to the lilt of the original French.  Le film, c'est magnifique!"
"Just the name of the picture makes you want to see if this is a BOMB or an interesting story! As I watched the beginning of the picture and watched Christian Slater,(Julian Po),""Mindhunters"",'04, stroll down this very old town that looked like it was from the Dark Ages, it started to capture my interest. Julian Po picks this town to sort of destroy himself and runs into all kinds of situations, meeting a minister, barber, hotel owner and lots of women for warm romantic SEX! Po meets Robin Tunney,(Sarah),""Paparazzi"",'04 who arranges all kinds of candles around his bed and falls madly in love with him. Christian Slater and Robin Tunney gave outstanding performances in a rather difficult character role. You can possibly laugh and cry with this film."
"Don't let those other reviews keep you from checking out this movie and fashioning your own opinion.Richard Dreyfuss isn't washed out; he's just showing us his funny side (like Stakeout).  Its nice that a classic drama actor can move to comedy and still be successful.This is a clever movie, with even more clever lines.  The banter, the pretense - heck, the whole movie had be chuckling from to start to finish. The sight gags aren't overdone - in fact, so smoothly executed (even by the kids) you'll be laughing all the way through at the antics.Look for a priceless appearance by Mila Kunis (known as Jackie on That 70's Show) in the classroom demonstration."
"May be in the world where i live, people dont just shout on each other for everything. And I tell you not everyone will talk it out loud as soon as problem comes, maybe its because the place i lived or because of the time i lived is different. But not everyone makes an issue out of everything always all the time. The only thing i liked about this show is how they showed the coming out process. I never felt the angst of wasting a lot of time watching this, but yet i watched it because of the cliff-hanging of dawson-joey."
"I loved this show, but what's going on with the folks at IMDb.com not listing the two main characters on the cast listing on the main page? Well, if they won't I will... Everybody watched the show to see Malik Yoba and and Michael DeLorenzo who played the Black and Puerto Rican detectives. Also, I think Michael Michelle played Malik Yoba's love interest on the show... plus there was a Puerto Rican female detective who was dating Michael Delorenzo's character on the show. That's who people watched for, not the unrecognizable names that is listed under the cast for the show. Also, there were plenty of guest stars that were on the show... I think Mary J. Blige, Tyra Banks, Terrence Howard, Diana Krall as jazz singer... where are those folks listed?"
"I understand that move such big story to movie is not simple task, but why again bend everything to such big cliché? The characters were flat, they bring me no emotion, someone was killed? And what, who was it actually?If you want know the strong story, watch the 4part France mini series with Gérard Depardieu. Do you want some simple movie for evening? This is good enough.And really notice that the movie is from end of the 18th century, there were no Afro-Americans with freedom, you can have you correctness, but it change nothing about history. We should display it and then we can learn from it. Not to try to lie."
"Two wealthy step-siblings of an elite Manhattan prep school make a wager: to de-flower the new headmaster's daughter (Reese Witherspoon) before the start of term.Having gone to high school in the latter half of the 1990s, this was one of those films that really defined a generation. All the big stars of the day were in it, and at least one 9Witherspoon) has one on to bigger and better things. At the time I was not aware that this was a remake of a 1980s film. I found it to be brilliant and quite deviously original.I now know that it is a remake, but think no less of it because of this. In many ways, this film is even more powerful. John Malkovich did a fine job capturing what spoiled aristocrats can do, but it is all the more troublesome what spoiled teenagers can do."
"A funny movie? Not quite so. It begins pretty normal but becomes more and more bizarre and eventually culminates in a bang which releases the viewer into his/her reality. The characters are brilliant, the timid and frail girlfriend/teacher on one hand and the scary and dominant wife/'sister' on the other. In between the husband like a ping-pong ball being played with by the two females. The movie's pace is slow but sufficiently fast to push the story forward. The turn it takes might appear kinky to some but due to the careful evolvement the story stays plausible. Taking place in one location and sticking to the three main characters the movie appears like a nice intimate play which one needs to get into it to fully enjoy."
"From Hell is meticulously produced and has some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in a horror movie.Although the story about who Jack the Ripper is is a little contrived at times, in general the plot is interesting. All the actors involved are excellent and the movie has the grisly moments you'd expect, considering the subject-matter. It keeps you interested and involved for the whole two hours, not to mention it looks beautiful.Heather Graham and gang as prostitutes put in a great and touching performance, showing the human side of the women that are unfortunate enough to have been in this profession in the Victorian era, and Johnny Depp is amazing, as usual, although (as others have pointed out) his English accent may be a little off, which I wouldn't know about since I'm American.This film is great entertainment and I would highly recommend buying the DVD (if you rent it you'll more than likely end up buying it anyway, it's that good). From Hell makes a great addition to any movie collection.Also, buying it will help support the ""WE WANT MORE R-RATED HORROR MOVIES"" campaign!"
"Growing up in the backwoods of Kentucky, Larry Flint would make moonshine as a kid. As an adult, Larry Flynt (Woody Harrelson) runs a strip club in Cincinnati. Althea Leasure Flynt (Courtney Love) is the new strippers. Then he publishes Hustler magazine as a regular guy's Playboy. It gets notoriety with the publication of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis pics. The brash offensive pornographer comes to the attention of righteous Charles Keating (James Cromwell) and gets charged. Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton) is his lawyer in the long running battle with the government.It's a great performance from Woody Harrelson in one of the most compelling modern characters. Love him or hate him, one cannot ignore Larry Flynt. Also one should not ignore this performance. Surprisingly Courtney Love gives a coherent and wonderful performance. It's a quick moving movie despite a lot of courtroom drama. It takes a dirty subject and shines a light on a brighter meaning."
"I would consider thillu mullu as one of the best films of Superstar Rajinikanth and a best comedy film of tamil industry. K.Balachander brings both style and humour sense from Rajinikanth. And the film's centre role is Thengai Sreenivasan's role and he gives a flawless acting(especially when he says ""udambellam pullarikkudhuppa""). Showar janaki proved in this film that she will be able to make fans laugh also.Dialogues by Visu suits best for the movie.Overall Thillu mullu remains as a comedy flick of Rajinikanth to prove that he not only do stylish and mass films.Guest role by Kamal haasan at the end of the movie is a surprise element.Music by M.S.Vishwanathan adds a positive energy to the movie."
"Virus starts off well enough setting things up, the Mir Space Station encounters a spacial anomaly just as it is sending a transmission to a russian science and research ship in the north atlantic.  The ship recieves it and their computer core goes haywire.  Jamie Lee Curtis and crew happen on the ship while in the eye of a hurricane.  Something is mentioned about maritime rules that if an abandoned ship is floating in international waters it is up for salvage.  Soon they discover they are not alone on the ship. After this point, the movie becomes very redundant, they encounter some aspect of this cybernetic creature, they fight they run away, repeat as necessary.  It then comes to a very predictable and quick ending.  The crew's connection with each other is bland and uninteresting. In my opinion if you want a good movie on cyborgs, see the terminator films, robocop, or star trek first contact."
"To say this film is almost the clone of Jurassic Park (no pun intended) is to give Spielberg credit.  This film is a large drop off from the original and while sequels don't get up to the original, this one does try, but flails.  Story has ex mathematician/celebrity Ian Malcolm (played with some clueless finesse by Jeff Goldblum) going to another island by Attenborough with dinosaurs running loose with chaos and other plot things ensuing. Sometimes entertaining compared some other c**p, but to view along side the original is a no-brainer.  One other thing, why put the first smashing scene from the first book into the second movie?  Best scene for me though isn't T-Rex in San Diego (despite that being fun), but rather Vince Vaughn being chased by little reptile dinosaur things.  B-"
"All the teenagers that collect guns are going to like this movie but for me was pretty bad, boring and too violent, blood everywhere I didn´t enjoy at all this movie, I don´t understand whats the big deal also I didnt like any of the characters. Quarantino is not the best writter and likes blood to much, is not a movie for everybody, I should add that has too many bullets and could have been done much better with less blood and violence, but is Quarantino, this also give me an excuse to look for better movies and choose more carefully. My advice skip this movie and look for something better, is a waste of time."
"I just watched this one at broadcast.com.It is an interesting movie, but not a very complete one.  Like many low budget movies, the cinematography is poor.  Scenes do not flow well, but seem to jump around.  At times, things are overdone and at times they are way under done.The acting is acceptable.The movie also lacks is a logical plot.  Things are not tied together well. Events just happen, without any logical sense.The opening & ending scenes are quite intriguing, but unfortunately the rest of the movie falls short.  It was a good idea, in theory, but it just doesn't deliver.  Overall, slightly above average 6/10."
"I wish I could find an online group for people who LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie, so that we could recommend other movies with this kind of magic... ""Movie recommendations for those who LOVE Pastime, but HATE Bull Durham"". That's right... I HATED Bull Durham, but I LOVE Pastime. This is the ultimate movie for when you know you won't be disturbed and you're all alone on a hot summer night. Watching this movie is like taking a journey in a time machine to another time and place, and just being there, and tasting and smelling it all. Several movies have tried to convey that strange mystical something that only true baseball lovers get (but can never explain), but Pastime nails it. Most will have no clue what I'm talking about, but you who do... you get it."
"I enjoyed most of this movie.  There were some great performances by Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, John C. Reilly, and Philip Seymour Hoffman.  I was enthralled with the stories.  Then Paul Thomas Anderson decided to insert this musical montage.  I had real problems with it.  To have two nearly comatose characters lip synch to a pop song blew it for me. I then saw the characters as actors acting a role.  I could suspend belief and get involved in the lives of the people portrayed before the montage but afterwards I watched craft.  The story no longer touched me.  I was just waiting for the final reel to tie up loose ends.  This movie could have been a classic.  It could have been a contender. Was the music meant to tie the characters together, to link the separate stories.  Isn't that what writing is for?  Couldn't he use a less obvious device?  That montage will look really goofy in 10 years."
"This movie is not great, but it is damn good. I enjoyed it and the humor it provided. The acting is outstanding and helps you forget the seemingly endless plot holes there seems to be. This movie is highly entertaining and enjoyable and I'd recommend it to anyone. It does have some shortcomings I won't go into to prevent spoiling the movie. It's not the perfect movie and has some shortcomings but a movie this entertaining would be too good to pass up. There is some great scenes and the story isn't perfect but the actors help pull this one together. I liked it and will give it a passing grade and because I have to go ten lines with this I will say it is worth seeing again--6/10"
"He's not Hollywood handsome and can't dance. He has more tenacity than brains and is more impulsive than courageous. He has a tendency to act first, think later, and screw up. He will apologize, but only if it's really necessary and not everything works out in the end for him. Such is the central character in ""The Taxman"" (Pantoliano), an okay cops vs crime flick with the twist being the hero is a federal tax investigator who stumbles into a mafia-style operation and has almost as much trouble with the system as he has with the hoodlums. ""The Taxman"" is an earnest effort and a worthwhile watch for those who are looking for a down-to-earth crime flick."
"I loved ""the Scarlet Dove"", a brilliant finnish film noir from 1961. And here's another brilliant finnish film noir directed the next year by Arne Taarkas, ""Hän Varasti Elämän"" with a terrific Risto Mäkelä as the crazy who kills those who discover his new life. He was not a recognized accountant, and one night, while carrying a cash payroll, he kills a lonely man and takes his identity and flee with the fortune payroll. Arriving in a village with that fortune, he becomes admired and well respected man. But fate never sleeps, the incredible never seen ending concludes a mad criminal life, but maybe ... Shot on location, all scenes are really realistic, and Risto Mälekä is impressive as the killer, some kind od Edmond O'Brien in ""the Third Voice"". And his scenes with his sexy maid are daring for that time."
"Sorry to say I cant agree with all the reviewers who obviously loved this film. I thought it was sentimental hokum.The retro view of 40s Mississipi just looked so staged.The situations were almost all ridiculous and it simply lacked any real emotional honesty. I had hoped that this film might be similar in feel to Hallstroms ""My Life as a Dog"" a truly original and wondrous coming of age film. Maybe I am becoming cynical as I age or maybe this movie was too Hollywood for me.So apologies to all of this movies fans ....it just didn't do it for me. As a genre there are a number of coming of age films out there to choose from.Whilst I am sure the director set out to portray an honest view of childhood there are too many other films that achieve a better and more credible vision."
"There's something different about ""The Hard Way"", something in its approach to a well-worn genre. Buddy cop movies were all over the place back then, and here's another one to throw on the pile. But having a pampered actor hang around a disgruntled cop offers an opportunity for Hollywood satire, which freshens up the mismatched partners angle. James Woods tends to be hit-or-miss for me, but he's ideal in such a hothead role. And wired Michael J. Fox provides a great foil. The whole thing works; the script's focused, the action's energetic and it always has that meta feel to it.7/10"
"This is one of my favourite movies, one of the very few horror movies that don't scare me, and I prefer the ending of this over the original movie. I have the book this is based off, and this is one of the very few movies that I can watch more than once without growing bored of it. My favourite part is that David stands out the most (in a good way) among the alien children and he's my favourite character in the movie along with how he can feel empathy and he can understand people's feelings. He has a heart and he's misunderstood, but that was only because the child he was supposed to be paired with died. It's just amazing to me how it became a mixed blessing, even though the death was bad, but it's helped him out in the way that he's portrayed as a good, but misunderstood. I don't have anything negative at all to say about this movie!"
"This is the worst film you will ever see, please stay away from it. i have joined this site only to tell people not to watch this film, now i have to write 10 lines saying how bad it is. Its stupid, its not funny, i hate it, i told all my friends it was good so they would watch it and now they hate me, Jennifer Love Hewitt is hardly in it, please don't buy, rent, borrow this. How Emma Woodhouse says this is good is, i kinda hate her a bit, i'm sorry Emma, i'm sure you're a great girl but for real, this isn't a good film, 94 minutes of badness, i know this film as love sucks, no, this film sucks. Only one more line to go, but i could go on forever hating this film."
"Even with Rob Reiner's name attached, ""The American President"" is an Aaron Sorkin movie; I don't mean just his superb dialogue, but it seems fair to say that it feels like ""The West Wing"" as a romantic comedy (i.e. right up my alley). The president's painted as an actual person, while still paying deference to the office. As political as this is, it's still a patriotic movie. The music swells at just the right moments, the ideas espoused have resonance, and you just get sucked into it.I'll be honest, with Martin Sheen in the cast, they could've gotten anyone to play the commander-in-chief and I'd still be a fan. But as Hollywood presidents go, Michael Douglas is a great one.7/10"
"Boasting the sort of line-up producers dream of (lots of high quality names that you don't need an Armageddon budget to get hold of), Rounders sizzles from the first moment to the last. Matt Damon (along with his butch mate Affleck) are proving themselves to be immensely capable on screen as well as writing.The support actors are two actors who have won Oscars for supporting (Landau/Norton) - both of whom show why they are award-winning at this stage in their career. And perhaps the finest actor alive, John Malkovich giving the best performance I have seen in a movie this year.This film also stars Famke Janssen which is reason enough."
Jim Carry can be funny. I thought this movie was funny when it first came out and I was 11 years old. Now that I'm 30 I don't find it very funny any more. When I was kid I was big Jim Carry fan. Now that I'm older not was mush. But he is a good actor. I can think of some good movie he was in. When I was kid I felt that Batman forever was his best. And you know what it is. This is one of the movies with Jim Carry I loved as a kid and I still enjoy watching it has an adult. I can't with this movie any more. You have to be 11 to like the hummer in this movie. Ace V.e.n.t.u.r.a When natures calls is better and that was not to good. I don't get why adults like this movie. It is not funny it is stupid.
"If you're looking for a fairly interesting diversion, Rush Hour should fit the bill.  The action sequences are excellent due to Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker keeps the mood comic, which is smart because this film could never be taken seriously.  Rush Hour is a good formula picture.  Put either actor alone in a movie and it wouldn't work. (I've seen other Jackie Chan movies, when he's not kickin' ass, it gets boring real quick). Tucker, who is an acquired taste, fills in nicely between fights.  Pretty good for a buddy movie, even better than 48hrs.  6.8 out of 10 stars."
"Rab c nesbitt is a very underrated comedy the show had been forgotten until the release of series 1 DVD back i 2004, of course more followed u can get up to series 5 now. I hope more series come to DVD. why is it the good old comedys wait so long to come to DVD, Rab c nesbitt in one word excellent a must see show. its not hard to understand as a lot of people have made it out to be, the plot a glasgow drunk putting the world to right in a conservative government. i would love to see rab veiws on new labour, the show does loose a little edge after the death of eric cullen he also in lots of people eyes was the starr of the show. long live rab a legend"
"Most people like to trash this movie without seeing it. Its turns out preatty good. it's no oscar contender, but great for it's genre. You got very good emotions from Kurt Russel, considering he says maybe only 50 words, but this comes off preatty good. The beginning was excellent, very disturbing, the ending could have been better, but still I never felt like I had scene it somewere else. The main character resembles Alex from A clockwork orange, he changed, not in a dramatic way, but slowly. But hey, rent it, and don't expect Blade Runner or Minority Report! You should really watch it if you are instristed in action or sci/fi"
"As an exercise in ""cinema du look"" Clubbed to Death is an outright tour de force of moody, atmospheric shot-making; yet its let down by its very sparse story which barely holds its 80 minute length and might as well have been written on a handkerchief. It's a pity, because the dank, underground club vibe is spot-on for the mid-1990s dance music scene. The best aspect of the film is the lighting and the dynamic choice of music, provided by such hipsters as Daft Punk and Masters at Work to namedrop but a few. In this sense, the film has limited appeal for clubheads. The acting is a bit dazed and confused which was probably the intention. This is an often intriguing attempt to tell a sparse story through dramatic visual flourishes."
"Ad man Steve Brooks (Perry King) is a womanizing male chauvinist pig. His girlfriends Margo Brofman (JoBeth Williams), Liz (Lysette Anthony) and another join forces to kill him. Every woman hates him and he isn't allowed into heaven. He is sent back to find one woman who truly likes him. The Devil (Bruce Payne) objects and changes him into a woman Amanda Brooks (Ellen Barkin). She claims to be Steve's half-sister. His best friend Walter Stone (Jimmy Smits) takes a liking to Amanda.Ellen Barkin is a great dude but she's not necessarily a good comedian. This Blake Edwards comedy is not hitting exactly. I can see this work if Amanda is played by a great physical comedian. It's as if Edwards assumes that the man for woman thing would be easily funny for him once again. I also don't buy that she got Steve's job so easily. Another thing is the premise that making him a woman would automatically make it harder to get a woman to love him. Although I do like its resolution."
"I recently saw LIFE on tv for the first time and I must say I was impressed and most of all SURPRISED. I expected a very rude, crude kind of humor from such ""bad boy"" actors like Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence-famous for their constant foul mouthing. But LIFE was more of a comedy-drama, that had some very nice sequences, and thankfully was not filled with innuendos, and such. I do know the film has swearing, even though I saw it on tv I can always tell when they're cutting language out of a film, but it still is not as much as one would expect. If you want to have a fun night watching a good film, rent Life. Even if you're not fans of Murphy and Lawrence (which I can't say I am) you will still have a good time. It has an uplifting ending. LIFE believe it or not, is just one of those heart-warming comedy films. Enjoy! 3.5/5 stars JOHN ULMER"
"I saw this movie accidentally on 2/22/2004 from Cinemax. Then the story of this cavalry movie really touched me. I wondered very much how the cavalry soldiers felt when they were to be replaced with mechanized units. It must be a very difficult time for them. Because I didn't remember the title of this movie after I saw it, I had tried very hard to find out more history behind this movie. For example, I found one thesis titled¡§GREASY AUTOMATONS AND THE HORSEY SET : THE U.S. CAVALRY AND MECHANIZATION, 1928-1940"", written by VINCENT J. TEDESCO III for his Master Degree at THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, THE GRADUATE SCHOOL, COLLEGE OF THE LIBERAL ARTS in May 1995. I tried to study if this movie story was real. Eventually I searched IMDb today and got some information about this movie. I feel very happy that IMDb provides such useful data of all movies. I would appreciate very much if people can tell me any more true history of those characters in this movie."
"I didn't expect much from Romeo Must Die so I was pretty surprised by how much I liked it.  Nothing about the story is new or innovative but some good actors and entertaining fight scenes save the movie.  Aaliyah is a very natural actress and her chemistry with Jet Li is just right.  Li demonstrates that he is an incredibly skilled martial artist and has charming wit and style.  I look forward to seeing more of his work.  The supporting performances are good all around, especially from veteran actor, Delroy Lindo.  The one problem I had with the movie was that the fight scenes depended too much on special effects when Li's talent on display should have been enough.  I did however enjoy watching a bone chilling special effect that is used to show the core of combatants before their ultimate demise.  Overall, I give it an 8/10."
"On the surface, Porco Rosso (1992) is a lushly animated adventure flick with a tinge of nostalgia for the pilots of the 1920s. Underneath the skin, its a film fraught with anxiety about war and fascism. In some ways, it is like Miyazaki's first feature, The Castle of Cagliostro (1979), a seemingly frothy popcorn film that contains well-hidden sadness at the core; however, here that sadness is much more visible.This seems to be one of Miyazaki's lesser known films for whatever reason. Is it because the main character is a middle aged man disillusioned with life instead of a child or teenager? Is it the pre-WWII setting? Is it the lack of fantasy elements (outside of the protagonist having turned himself into a pig, that is)? I don't know, but it's a shame."
"This is the type of film that you can just sit back and enjoy. The male leads(Diggs, Epps and Jones) have chemistry as well as their young counterparts. The plot is simple and easy to follow. Roland(Diggs) is about to get married, but chickens out and goes over an old girlfriends house instead.Then Mike(Epps) and Slim(Jones) are sent over there to go get him before the wedding. While getting him sobered up, Mike reminisced on when they first met. This movie is better than movies of the same theme(The Best Man, The Brothers, etc.) because the male leads are more likable and less one dimensional, although Rolands reasons for not wanting to get married aren't explained enough. Also, the girl that plays young Alicia is way too old for the role.Bottom line, the narrative by Epps is good and it's not riddled with stereotypes. Also, the 80's soundtrack is great and this is an entertaining movie. 7/10"
"This movie was good all around...acting, casting, script, etc. It intertwined comedy and drama without missing a beat, while dealing with a very ""taboo"" subject in our society. I have seen a few other movies that focused on gay relationships but they didn't seem real to me. They seemed to focus on either the stereotypical lifestyle, on portraying them as victims of society, or were over-dramatized. Watching ""Jeffrey"" allowed me to feel the emotions of the characters and get pulled into their lives and issues and feel their highs and lows right along with them. The characters were going through everyday emotional relationship ordeals that I could relate to as a heterosexual as well as some specific issues that homosexuals face. I highly recommend this movie...it is interesting and different. SPOILER AHEAD! SPOILER AHEAD!--->I've never seen a movie before where I was passionately rooting for two men to get together and kiss. It's not because I have a closed mind but I was never able to connect to the characters enough before.<-----END OF SPOILER"
"Donald Duck has always been one of my favourites, which is reason enough to see The New Spirit. The message is interesting for the time, but feels dated I agree by today's standards. But other than that, there is very little to criticise. The animation is wonderful with lots of colour and detail, the war-like images are almost harrowing while the music is lush and catchy. The New Spirit has some fine moments like the ending and particularly the almost surreal part where the writing accessories come to life, and while things get more serious after a subtly humorous start it gets its point across without feeling too heavy-handed. Donald is strongly characterised, with his fever-pitch enthusiasm steadily wavering, and comes across as a very relevant spokesperson.All in all, well made and fascinating if with a dated message. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"The film is very unique, not only in sometimes the way it was filmed and the musical score that accompanies it, but the whole story's focus and time period are very unique. I felt as if the film was truly interesting because of the aforementioned, and thus something that was very gripping in its' own way. There is constantly breaths of fresh air blown into the plot of the film, making sure that each scene leaves you anticipating the next.I always liked this film because of the fact that you cannot exactly put your finger on it, and you are never quite sure what, exactly, is going on and where the film is going -- it is the sort of film that from time to time I think back to, thinking of all of the unique characteristics that went into it; all of the unique aspects that makme it stand out. Antonia Bird did an incredible job with this film because with all of these elements coming together, one can say it is truly a film that you have never quite seen anything like it."
"This show used to be good and had a bit of a resurgence in the early 2000s but it has steadily been declining for almost 10 years, it is time to mercy kill this show by pulling the plug. Not funny or relevant any more the cast is not as good as they used to be, the new cast members are not up to snuff, the writing is totally hack now. I don't know why CBC keeps dragging out the same awful 'comedy' year after year after year long after it is time to put this show out of it's misery and bury it in the nearest ditch. The badness of recent years has completely tarnished what this show used to be. It's a huge mistake they didn't let this show die gracefully instead of putting it on TV year after year without obviously caring about any quality."
"This movie felt like something unfinished. It surely deserved to be developed into something bigger. But what's there is fascinating, sweet, and somewhat unique. The way it portrays the first days of college for a girl who's alone in a big unknown city, with unfriendly and opportunist people, is just awesome. I really felt sorry for this cheerful, shy and friendly girl who couldn't manage to get a decent social relationship in this new environment. The lead actress was really good and always had that ""sweet and awkward"" aura that's just perfect for the character. Some great scenes in this movie, but who's familiar with the work of Shunji Iwai shouldn't be surprised about that: this guy can pull off memorable stuff."
"Very good morale booster. A thrilling drama with some terrific looking F/X. A rebellious Navy navigator(Owen Wilson)convinces his pilot(Gabriel Macht)into flying into a no-fly zone and gets shot down by Bosnian troops. His commanding officer(Gene Hackman)politically has his hands tied and it appears there will be no immediate rescue. The pilot is executed by an overzealous secret police officer who now leads the chase to find and catch the navigator who earlier was craving some action. The navigator must now survive long enough to reach the rescue point that may or may not be his salvation. Also notable in the cast are David Keith, Olek Krupa and Charles Malik Whitfield. Intense and exciting film."
"Once again, the animals and their corresponding voices from famous actors make up the bulk of the film (as opposed to real-life actors Robert Hays and Kim Griest playing actual people). Also, we have a similar theme as in the first ""Homeward Bound"" with animals lost and having to find their way home. This sequel is not as good as the original. It dwells a little too much on the romance between the two dogs, and it doesn't show enough interesting scenes in San Francisco, which you would really expect from the title of the film alone. The animals stayed too long in one spot and should have been on the move more.Otherwise, Michael J. Fox and Sally Field once again have a ton of gag lines to speak as the dog and cat, respectively. Many of their lines were good, some very clever that kids won't understand. The jokes of those two were the highlight of the movie. There were no annoying or evil villains, or even bad-guy dog catchers.All in all, it was okay but nothing special."
