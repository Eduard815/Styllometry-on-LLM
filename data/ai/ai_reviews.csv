"I’ll admit I went into this movie with a raised eyebrow. The idea of Danny DeVito being cast as a high-powered Wall Street predator sounds like a stunt on paper, and the romantic angle with Penelope Ann Miller is a stretch the film doesn’t fully justify. There’s also a missing layer: you can sense there’s history between certain characters that never quite gets unpacked.

That said, once it gets moving, it’s surprisingly fun and confident. DeVito doesn’t try to play the role “big”; he leans into his own presence and ends up feeling completely credible as a ruthless dealmaker with street instincts. By the middle, I wasn’t questioning it anymore—I was buying the whole persona.

The supporting cast helps a lot. Dean Jones brings a weary, pragmatic energy that grounds the corporate scheming, and Gregory Peck delivers the kind of steady, authoritative performance you expect from him. Flaws aside, it’s an entertaining watch."
"This isn’t the kind of film you’d automatically associate with Kitano if you only know him for sudden brutality or tough-guy cool. That contrast is exactly why it works. Here he steps back from the spotlight and lets the mood do the heavy lifting. The rhythm is deliberately unhurried, with long stretches where very little “happens” in the conventional sense, yet it never feels empty. It’s more like watching someone think.

The story follows a man trying to keep his everyday obligations from crushing what he actually cares about—work, art, and the complicated gravity of romance pulling in different directions. It quietly asks whether ambition is a gift or a trap, and whether hope survives routine.

If you’re patient with slow cinema, the payoff is subtle but lingering."
"I picked this up as part of a multi-disc compilation of classic Jolly Frolics cartoons, and it ended up being one of the more memorable entries. A quick heads-up: there are light plot details below. This installment in the Ham and Hattie run is essentially two bite-sized cartoons stitched together with music, which makes it feel like a mini program rather than a single short.

The first segment follows Hattie as she fusses over a little sailboat in a fountain. It’s simple, charming, and driven more by rhythm and visuals than dialogue, with a small mishap that’s resolved thanks to a helpful authority figure.

The second piece shifts gears to a small-town ensemble that’s treated like background noise—until an important guest is on the way and suddenly everyone needs a band. The turnaround is funny and a bit pointed. Overall, the set is a great purchase, and this pairing is an easy recommendation."
"Scary Movie feels like it’s making fun of the exact thing that drives me crazy in most slashers: characters surviving only because they keep choosing the worst possible option. The opening bit nails that point immediately—our “victim” has chances to grab something useful, and instead goes for the most ridiculous item imaginable. It’s not scary, but it’s a perfect jab at how horror scripts force people to act brain-dead just to keep the plot moving.

What surprised me is how committed the cast is. The Wayans, Anna Faris, and the rest lean into the overacting and cheesy line delivery like they’re channeling every forgettable teen thriller from the 90s. If you’ve just sat through a serious horror movie that annoyed you, this is a great palate cleanser."
"I’ve been dipping back into 90s action lately, and this one came recommended as one of Jean-Claude Van Damme’s tighter, more suspenseful outings. The setup is simple but effective: Darren McCord is an ex-firefighter carrying heavy guilt from a past rescue gone wrong, now trying to be a steady dad to his two kids. He takes them to a big hockey playoff game, expecting a fun night out—only for the arena to become the perfect trap when a ruthless gang, led by a greedy mastermind, seizes high-profile hostages in a luxury suite.

What I liked most is how quickly the film gets moving. Van Damme plays McCord as more worn-down and determined than invincible, and the confined arena setting keeps the tension high without feeling repetitive. The villain is also surprisingly memorable, with enough personality to make the standoffs enjoyable.

It’s not deep cinema, but it’s a solid, crowd-pleasing action thriller with decent pacing, clear stakes, and a few genuinely exciting moments."
"I sat down to watch this film mainly because I’d enjoyed the lead actor in a much better action flick and figured he could carry another project. Big mistake. Whatever charm and intensity he had elsewhere gets wasted here on a movie that can’t decide what story it’s telling. Scenes stumble along like they belong to different scripts, and the characters are either thinly drawn or downright irritating. A certain supporting actress I usually find grating only makes it harder to stay engaged. By the halfway point I was checking the time and wondering how something this muddled made it past editing. I borrowed it, thankfully, but it still felt like I’d overpaid."
"I grew up thinking 20/20 was the gold standard for TV news magazines. When Barbara Walters and Hugh Downs were in the anchor chairs, the program felt like it had a purpose: digging into shady businesses, tracking down con artists, and doing the kind of reporting that actually made you feel a little smarter (and safer) as a viewer. The undercover segments were the highlight for me, and Stossel’s commentary pieces had a bite to them that you didn’t see anywhere else.

Somewhere along the way, that edge disappeared. After Downs left, the pacing and tone started to shift, and once Walters was gone too it felt like the last connection to what made the show special had been cut. These days, it seems like 20/20 leans heavily on stories that have already been beaten to death online, or it drifts into celebrity-adjacent fluff that could’ve aired anywhere. Even the “investigations” often feel like lightweight myth-testing instead of real accountability journalism.

It’s disappointing, because the show used to feel essential. Now it mostly feels like filler dressed up as a news program."
"I picked up this movie mostly for Virginie Ledoyen, who I’ve enjoyed in other roles, and partly out of curiosity about Olivier Assayas behind the camera. Going in, I expected something sharper and more emotionally grounded than what I got, but I can’t say it left me cold, either.

Nearly everyone here feels wrapped up in their own reflection. Gabriel, played by Mathieu Amalric, is especially hard to take: he craves attention like oxygen, yet shuts down the moment anyone suggests he change course. The story drifts around Adrien, a novelist hovering at the edge of real life, writing books that seem to vanish the moment they’re finished. Most of the group is the same—underemployed, under-motivated, and oddly comfortable with drifting.

What kept me watching wasn’t the plot so much as the performances and the uneasy truthfulness of the mood. It’s not a film I’d rush to revisit, but the cast makes the aimlessness oddly watchable."
"I still can’t believe how little recognition this film got at the big awards. It deserved far more than just a nod for the lead actor. In my opinion it easily should have been in the race for best picture, and the soundtrack alone warranted major attention. The songs are genuinely memorable, especially “Aana Mere Pyar Ko Na Tum” and “Woh To Hai Albela,” which I can still hum without thinking.

What really lifts the movie is that it’s based on a true story, and that emotional core comes through. Shah Rukh Khan carries the whole thing with charm and sincerity; you buy his struggles and his stubborn hope. Without him, I doubt the film would have worked the same way, because the supporting cast is fine but not extraordinary.

The relationship angle, the effort to earn approval, and the light romantic comedy moments blend surprisingly well. Not his absolute best, but definitely one of his strongest romantic outings for me. 10/10."
"Mirror, Mirror (1990) is the kind of bargain-bin horror that makes me wonder what my younger self was thinking. I put it on expecting cheesy fun, but it mostly left me irritated. The setup sounds like it should work: a lonely high school girl (Rainbow Harvest) finds an antique mirror and starts using it as an escape from her miserable social life. Of course the mirror isn’t just a mirror—it feeds her anger and offers a shortcut to payback.

The problem is the movie never earns its big moments. The bullying feels cartoonish, the scares are weak, and the “power with a price” angle is handled in the bluntest way possible. When the mirror starts changing her, it’s more goofy than unsettling, and the pacing drags whenever it should be ramping up.

I’m genuinely confused why this got a nice home release; it’s not a hidden gem, it’s just messy. If you love it, I’d honestly like to hear the appeal. I won’t be revisiting it. Not recommended."
"The Coens open with that familiar “this really happened” tease, then spend the rest of the film gleefully yanking the rug out from under you. Jerry Lundegaard, a small-time dealership guy with big-time desperation, thinks he can solve his money problems by arranging his wife’s abduction and squeezing a ransom from his towering father-in-law. Naturally, the two crooks he hires are a catastrophic pair—more clueless than calculating—and what starts as a scheme quickly mutates into a trail of bad decisions and sudden violence.

Enter Marge Gunderson, a sharp, very pregnant police chief whose calm decency makes the surrounding chaos even stranger. The movie balances bleakness with deadpan humor in a way that feels effortless. The snowy visuals are pristine, the characters are memorably odd, and Macy’s jittery performance is painfully perfect. Dark, funny, and unsettling all at once."
"I’m with a lot of the other reviewers on this one: it doesn’t get nearly the attention it deserves. I usually gravitate toward big historical dramas, but this movie hooked me for a different reason—it’s less about the headlines and more about watching a deeply troubled person unravel from the inside out. Even if you couldn’t care less about the political backdrop, the character study is gripping and surprisingly intimate.

The acting across the board is phenomenal, with the women in particular bringing a lot of heartbreak and quiet strength to their roles. I also have to give major credit to the director’s bold style choices; the film swings for the fences and somehow stays coherent and compelling. I enjoy a few of his other well-known titles, but this is the one that feels the most daring and fully realized."
"Somehow this so-called family film keeps popping up on my TV, and every time I catch a few minutes I’m amazed it got released at all. The plot feels like a half-baked joke that spiraled into a screenplay during a late-night hangout, and the execution doesn’t do it any favors. It’s marketed for kids, yet it tosses in a bizarre “danger” subplot that’s both unsettling and never properly accounted for. The canine lead is supposed to carry the charm, but the dog looks confused, and the human cast isn’t much more convincing. Visually, it resembles a community theater project shot behind someone’s shed, complete with a “big” sports finale where the crowd could fit in a small classroom. Then it limps to the finish with narration that screams, “We ran out of money.”"
"Older films can be weirdly underrated, and this spy farce is one of those cases. It’s definitely not prestige cinema, but it’s an easy, entertaining watch with a surprisingly busy plot. The story follows Jeff and Jane Blue, a married pair of agents who’ve just had a baby and are supposed to be on a break. Naturally, their “leave” turns into a job when an old superior pulls them back in for one last assignment in New Orleans. Their goal is more about nudging a shady Eastern European weapons seller into making a mistake than blasting their way through the city, which keeps things light and comedic.

What makes it fun is how many people are chasing the same tail at once. Two determined cops start sniffing around after Jeff interferes in a street crime, and a small-time hood with a bruised ego decides he needs payback too. Watching all these groups unknowingly trip over each other is the best part.

It’s also a neat time capsule of pre-Katrina New Orleans. Harder to track down than it should be, but worth it if you find it."
"A quartet of officers assigned to keep a key witness alive are taken out in a swift, brutal ambush led by hired gun Wanda and her crew. With his racketeering trial suddenly wobbling, prosecutor Daniel Graham fumes and races to replace the vanished testimony before mob chief Rusty Pirone walks. Meanwhile, Valerie Alston, a single mom serving on the jury, finds herself leaned on by Tommy Vesey, a former cop turned enforcer who knows exactly where to apply pressure.

As a crime thriller, it’s pretty standard stuff—ticking-clock tension, courtroom stakes, and familiar betrayals. What keeps it watchable is the cast: Quinlan brings an edge to an offbeat part, and Hurt clearly enjoys playing nasty. Whalley doesn’t always land the emotional beats, but overall it’s a serviceable, forgettable genre entry."
"THE CRYSTAL VILLAGE is yet another bargain-bin kids’ fantasy adventure with that unmistakable low-budget charm, reportedly filmed overseas with a tiny crew and a lot of enthusiasm. The hook is familiar: two curious siblings stumble onto a miniature civilization trapped inside a glowing artifact, and before long they’re dodging booby traps, navigating toy-sized streets, and trying to keep the place from being wiped out by a cranky band of interdimensional raiders. The plot is mostly silly, but it barrels forward so confidently that you end up going with it. The creature makeup is a hoot—very “late-night sci‑fi TV” in the best way—and the sets, while clearly modest, have a handmade ingenuity. There’s also a surprisingly early appearance from a now-recognizable young actor."
"Coming from a beloved stage story and an even better classic film, this remake looked like a sure thing. Charming leads? Check. A filmmaker who’s done sharp, witty work before? Check. It should’ve been an easy win for a warm, modern rom-com. Instead it feels smug, mechanical, and weirdly low-energy, as if everyone assumed the premise alone would carry it. The banter is flat, the plot hits every beat you see coming from miles away, and the “heart” arrives on schedule rather than naturally. If you’re hoping for the sparkle and snap of top-tier romantic comedy, you’ll end up frustrated. The only thing with real passion here is the relentless brand shilling. Save your time and watch the older version instead."
"This movie wants you to believe the skinhead crew has some kind of code, but every scene screams “train wreck with boots.” The hangout vibe is pure menace mixed with idiot bravado—like watching toddlers play gangster with real consequences. The casual cruelty is what gets me: one minute they’re talking loyalty, the next they’re dumping a “friend” like trash the second he’s inconvenient. And the big plans? Half-baked math, zero foresight, and a whole lot of “nobody will notice us” while looking like the most noticeable people on earth.

There are a few darkly funny moments—guys nodding off with a book in hand, tough talk collapsing into instant surrender—but the laughs are bitter. By the end, Hando’s not some legend; he’s just a lonely, angry mess watching his world evaporate."
"This softly observant film follows a young boy growing up with his family in northern England during the 1950s, and it feels deeply personal, as if the director is carefully paging through his own memories. What stays with you most is the craftsmanship: the imagery is luminous without calling attention to itself, and the sound design is used like a form of storytelling. Snatches of period music drift in and out, and familiar voices from classic cinema echo through the boy’s everyday world, blurring the line between lived experience and what’s playing on the screen. One extended sequence glides above classrooms, pews, and rows of seats in a picture house, and it’s hypnotic—ordinary routines becoming almost sacred. The movie ultimately makes a convincing case for cinema as refuge, ritual, and revelation."
"This film is a slick, steamy teen melodrama that never really lets up. The dialogue is blunt, the situations are deliberately provocative, and the story moves quickly from one temptation to the next. A restless, privileged girl pushes her cocky stepbrother—famous for keeping “scores”—into a cruel challenge: prove he can seduce an innocent, deeply religious classmate before the new term begins. The stakes are outrageous and personal, and watching the scheme unfold is equal parts entertaining and uncomfortable. He even detours with a naïve, bubbly friend who becomes another notch in his belt, until the game turns on him and real feelings complicate everything. The supporting adults add bite and dark humor, rounding out the scandalous fun."
"This film feels less like a story and more like a long wink to people who already know the industry gossip. There’s technically a plot in there somewhere, but it’s so flimsy that it mostly exists to shuttle you from one famous face to the next. A cameo can be a fun surprise; fifty of them in a row turns into a distraction. After a while I wasn’t reacting to the jokes, I was doing mental trivia: “Wait… is that actually them, or are they supposed to be some fictional version of themselves?” That gets old fast, and it starts to muddy scenes that should have some emotional weight.

I will say the lead performance kept me watching longer than I expected. It’s refreshing to see a solid actor actually carry a movie instead of being used for two minutes of recognition bait. Still, the script asks you to ignore some truly ridiculous logic—moments where a character would have to be blind, deaf, and incurious not to notice what’s happening right in front of them.

I understand why people admire it: it’s trying to say something about Hollywood. But ambition doesn’t automatically equal entertainment."
"“54” sets out to capture the myth of Studio 54, the late-70s playground for celebrities, beautiful people, and anyone chasing a velvet-rope fantasy. Ryan Phillippe plays a wide-eyed newcomer who gets swept up in the club’s glare, loosely echoing real staffers from that era. The trouble is, the movie confuses excess for insight. It’s drenched in neon, sweat, and pop soundtrack swagger, but it rarely digs into what that lifestyle costs the people living it.

You can feel it reaching for the sharp, unflinching bite of a darker showbiz exposé, yet it never commits, bouncing between scandal, romance, and cautionary tale without landing on any of them. Mike Myers, as the volatile owner, is stuck in a half-serious part that doesn’t give him much room to surprise. In the end, it’s more pose than punch—and not much fun, either."
"Let me lay it out: I’m a huge movie fan, and Toy Story is still a near-perfect classic. But the 3-D re-release? It felt like paying a cover charge to walk into my own living room. I kept waiting for that “wow” moment where depth actually adds something, and it barely showed up. Most scenes looked exactly like the regular version, only dimmer, with the occasional bit of separation that disappears as soon as you notice it. 

What really stings is the upcharge. Not only are you buying a ticket for a film you probably already own, you’re also paying extra for the glasses, as if the experience is somehow premium. If you’ve seen Toy Story before, you’re not getting a fresh take—just a pricier replay. Save your money."
"This is a movie about the messy, funny, occasionally exhausting reality of making a movie. It follows a single day on a shoestring set, where every problem is solved with duct tape, stubbornness, and a little luck. More than a plot-driven story, it’s a love letter to the people who keep indie productions alive—crew members juggling roles, actors waiting around, and a director trying to hold everything together. The style feels confidently minimalist, with some striking monochrome moments that give it an art-house vibe without feeling precious. The cameos are a treat, too, and the performances sell the chaos. If you’ve never cared how films get made, it may drag. If you have, it’s delightful."
"To start, I’d call this talk show decent, even though I definitely haven’t watched every single episode. When it’s on, I usually find myself sticking around for a while, and I can even hum parts of the opening music from memory. Not every subject they dive into interests me, and some segments feel a bit drawn out. That said, I like when the host takes on the more heated, uncomfortable issues and keeps the conversation moving. The best moments are when guests actually reflect and you can see real changes happening by the end—those episodes are surprisingly satisfying. Overall, it’s not perfect, but it’s memorable. If it ever pops up in reruns, longtime fans should try to catch it again before it disappears completely."
"A gently witty comedy-drama from northern China, this film follows Ermo, a fiercely proud noodle seller who pushes herself to exhaustion with one clear goal: outdoing her better-off neighbors by buying the largest television around. The premise is simple, yet the story keeps finding small, revealing moments—arguments in cramped rooms, the bustle of the market, and a tender, awkward connection with a man who already has a family. That thread lands in an interesting place, sometimes played for laughs, sometimes unexpectedly moving. Performances feel natural rather than showy, and the director’s careful compositions make everyday life look quietly purposeful. It doesn’t race or aim for big climaxes, but the steady craftsmanship and human warmth linger after it ends."
"I’ll be honest: the pacing drags here and there, and a few jokes feel like they’re trying a little too hard to be “family friendly.” But once the story settles in, it turns into a surprisingly heartfelt look at growing up and realizing the world doesn’t stay the same just because you want it to. The film really nails that awkward transition from being the kid who dominated in youth leagues to suddenly being surrounded by bigger, faster, more polished players—especially in a new school environment where confidence doesn’t automatically carry over.

What hit me most was the emotional thread between the team and their former mentor. The main character’s sense of being left behind feels raw, and it adds weight to what could’ve been a standard sports sequel. By the end, it’s less about trophies and more about choosing who you want to be when the safety net disappears.

And the standout scene? That quiet talk about leadership and responsibility. It’s genuinely memorable."
"I went into Sphere with really low expectations after seeing all the mediocre IMDb scores, and it ended up completely winning me over. The pacing keeps shifting in a way that constantly throws you off balance, and just when you think you’ve figured out what’s happening, it veers somewhere else. People love to complain about how it wraps up, but honestly, the finale is what sealed it for me—it’s bold and unsettling in the best way. I’ve rewatched it more times than I’d like to admit, and it somehow stays tense even when you know the beats. I can see why it won’t click for everyone, and maybe my first watch caught me in the perfect mood, but I’m unapologetically obsessed with this movie."
"SHADOW STRIKE is a low-rent action movie from the late ’80s that never really comes together. It’s obviously trying to capture the breezy, macho energy of TV hits of the time, all dirt bikes, explosions, and tough-guy banter, but the script feels patched together and the performances are stiff. The first stretch plays like a melodramatic home-life subplot that drags on far too long before the plot finally shifts into gear: a woman gets snatched, and the lead charges in as a one-man rescue squad. To be fair, a few of the practical set pieces are surprisingly bold considering the thin resources, yet they land with little impact because the story gives you no reason to care."
"This movie follows Selena as she chases the life she’s always wanted. From the start, you can tell she’s determined, and her voice is treated like something truly special. I liked how the story didn’t only focus on the music, but also showed her making bold choices, like marrying the man she loved even though her father didn’t approve. My favorite section was when she stepped into fashion and started building something of her own outside of performing. The hardest moment to watch was the betrayal that led to her being shot by someone she trusted. That scene was heartbreaking and stayed with me. Even with the sadness, I thought the film was really well done, and I’d watch it again."
"I came to Columbia’s Fox & Crow shorts with low expectations, mostly because the tie-in comics never did much for me. This episode changed my mind. The anxious, high-strung Fox is obsessed with collecting eggs, and the Crow ends up guarding two precious ones as if they’re dependents he can’t abandon. Rather than fight him head-on, the Crow steers the whole situation into a stage routine, nudging the Fox into a makeshift vaudeville partnership that’s doomed from the first cue.  

The animation isn’t as lush as the studio’s earlier work; you can see the cost-cutting in the simpler designs and cleaner backgrounds. Still, the timing is sharp, the dialogue keeps things moving, and the slapstick escalates in a satisfying way. The characters’ personalities carry the comedy, and the ending lands with the kind of playful sting these shorts do best."
"Alright, I’ll admit I’m biased: give me a slick French action flick and I’m already halfway sold. But this one actually earns it. Instead of drowning every moment in moody speeches and circular arguing, it keeps the dialogue tight and lets the chase do the talking. The pacing is the real surprise—scenes don’t linger until they go stale, and the tension stays high without feeling like the director is showing off.

What I appreciated most is how the main driver isn’t turned into a generic trigger-happy hero. When things go sideways, he doesn’t default to guns or fistfights like a typical big-studio thriller. He wins by thinking like a speed addict, using timing and nerve to stay a step ahead of the thieves. Fast, lean, and way more fun than expected."
"I honestly had a blast with this movie. Is it a little corny? Absolutely. But that’s part of why it works so well. The pace is quick, the jokes keep coming, and I can’t think of many scenes that drag. I’ve seen people call it “stupid” or “messy,” but I think they’re missing the point—it’s meant to be wild, ridiculous fun, and it delivers.

The whole hotel setup is perfect, because every door that opens seems to unleash a new kind of chaos. I kept thinking, “There’s no way it can get worse for this guy,” and then it somehow does. The poor bellhop gets tossed into one insane situation after another, like the universe decided his first shift should be a survival test. If that were my first night on the job, I’d be out the door immediately.

Watch it with friends if you can. The shared laughter makes the over-the-top moments even better, and you’ll probably end up quoting it afterward."
"I’m usually not the target audience for animated musicals, so I hesitated before watching this, but a friend insisted and the glowing online scores made it sound like a safe bet. Honestly, I came away feeling duped. The story takes a respected Chinese tale and dresses it up with modern, jokey attitudes that don’t fit the setting at all. The heroine often comes off like she wandered in from a teen sitcom, and the wisecracking dragon sidekick never stops mugging for attention. Songs pop up at awkward moments and aren’t memorable, the humor relies on clumsy pratfalls, and every “twist” is visible miles ahead. Even with kids in the room, I doubt it would land. 5/10."
"In this installment of the Famous Studios series, Katnip is stuck pulling the late shift as a store guard at Stacy’s, only to stumble on Herman and his pals turning the toy section into their personal playground. Herman’s solution is suitably sneaky: he tries to persuade Katnip that he’s losing his marbles, and the cat’s mounting panic drives most of the laughs. The department store backdrop works wonderfully, since every aisle becomes a setup—furniture displays, gadgets, and kids’ toys all get pressed into service. Nothing feels groundbreaking, but the timing is tight and the elastic cartoon expressions keep the routine gags lively."
"I came away from this one feeling slightly baffled, as if I’d sat through a lads’ in-joke that forgot other people might be in the room. It’s steeped in that cosy myth of the endearing, flawed man-child: the fellas get all the texture and forgiveness, while the women mostly exist to be admired or to provide a convenient emotional mirror. The lead actress does what she can with the material and looks fantastic doing it, but the character is written more like an aspiration than a person you might actually meet.

What surprised me most was how half-hearted the “sporting” side felt. For something that leans so hard on football as atmosphere, the match moments are oddly generic—roars, slumps, rinse and repeat—without the specificity that makes it ring true.

By the end it tips into moody, self-regarding wistfulness that thinks it’s profound, when it’s really just damp and a bit adolescent. If you want something in the same orbit but sharper and more balanced, there are better choices."
"This is the movie that really cemented Jim Carrey as a must-watch comedy star for me. Even after seeing his earlier hits, this one feels like the perfect mix of wild physical humor and a surprisingly sincere heart. The premise is simple but brilliant: a slick attorney who bends the truth for a living suddenly can’t tell a single lie for 24 hours thanks to his kid’s birthday wish. Watching him try to navigate court, coworkers, and his own messy personal life without his usual shortcuts is nonstop chaos in the best way. Carrey plays Fletcher Reede with incredible energy, but he also lets the character’s regret and vulnerability show through when it counts. By the end, it’s not just funny—it lands an honest message about showing up for your family and being truthful with the people who trust you most."
"If you’re looking for an older vampire movie that still hits hard, this one is a blast. For something made back in the mid-90s, it delivers a surprisingly solid plot and keeps the tension going without getting boring. The cast sells it too—nobody feels like they’re just reading lines, and the characters actually make you care who lives. The effects hold up better than I expected, especially in the darker scenes where most films from that era look cheap. I’ve seen a lot of vampire stuff, and this ranks near the top for pure spooky fun. The rating it gets online feels a little low to me. I’d give it a strong 9/10. If this doesn’t creep you out, you might be impossible to scare."
"Cynthia Rothrock shows up, looks great, and throws hands like she was born doing it. Unfortunately, that’s basically the movie’s entire game plan. This is bargain-bin late-night cable fodder: cheap sets, awkward acting, and a script that feels like it was scribbled during a commercial break. The director also seems oddly interested in lingering on sweaty dudes more than anything else, which gives the whole thing a weird vibe. The action is serviceable when Cynthia’s on screen, and the finale goes for a nasty shock moment that at least wakes you up. But the hyperactive cutting and nonstop noise can’t hide how empty it is. If you’re a die-hard martial arts junkie, maybe. Everyone else: pick a classic instead."
"I grew up reading The Phantom, that endlessly rebooted jungle myth where the mask gets passed down and the “Ghost Who Walks” keeps punching criminals into the dirt. So when I finally sat down to watch the film, I was honestly excited just to see that world on screen.

The first thing the movie gets right is the period vibe. Setting it in the late ’30s gives it an old-serial flavor that fits the character, and the production design does a decent job selling the pulpy, globe-trotting adventure. A couple of the supporting performances help too; there are moments when the cast almost convinces you you’re watching a classic matinee romp.

But the problems pile up fast. The dialogue feels stiff and rushed, like nobody had time to make it sound like real people talking. Worse, the tone keeps wobbling between camp and serious action, so scenes that should build tension end up landing flat. The lead isn’t terrible, but he never fully becomes that legendary figure the comics promised.

There are a handful of fun sequences and a few atmospheric shots, yet overall it’s the kind of movie you put on for a lazy afternoon and barely remember a week later."
"I just got home from watching Bad Boys II and I’m still pumped. It’s one of those movies that keeps throwing action at you, but it never forgets to be funny. Even though it runs close to two and a half hours, it honestly flew by because something is always happening—chases, shootouts, and plenty of back-and-forth between the leads.

What really impressed me was how real a lot of it felt. You can tell they relied more on practical stunts than shiny computer effects. When cars get wrecked, they look truly wrecked, and the big destruction scenes have that heavy, “this actually happened” feel instead of looking like a video game cutscene.

I liked the first Bad Boys a lot, but this one feels bigger and a little wilder. I’ve seen some low ratings and I don’t get it. For me it’s easily a strong 4 stars. I’m definitely buying it the day it hits DVD."
"I usually roll my eyes at formulaic action flicks, but this one surprised me. It knows exactly what it is and leans into the silliness without trying too hard, which made it way more enjoyable than I expected. The dialogue has a few smart quips that actually landed, and the pacing rarely drags. For a movie that clearly wasn’t made with a massive wallet, the effects and stunts are better than they have any right to be—nothing groundbreaking, but solid and polished. I only gave it a shot because I grabbed it cheap at a discount rack, and I’m happy I did. Worth a casual watch, just don’t go in expecting a masterpiece."
"Brian De Palma is one of those directors I admire and argue with in the same breath. When he’s on, he’s electrifying; when he’s not, you can feel the machinery turning. “Carlito’s Way” sits right in that uneasy middle ground for me. On the surface it presents itself as a fairly standard gangster comeback story: a man gets out of prison, swears off the old life, and tries to go straight. But the film keeps tightening the screws until that promise feels less like a choice and more like a trap.

Al Pacino gives Carlito a weary warmth that makes you want to believe in him, even when his instincts keep dragging him back toward danger. Sean Penn, twitchy and slick as the lawyer friend, is a perfect catalyst for disaster. Where the movie stumbles is in how it sometimes romanticizes Carlito’s “inevitable” slide; a few turns feel staged for maximum operatic tension rather than earned behavior.

Still, De Palma’s set pieces are staged with real precision, and the final stretch is both clever and cruel. I just wish the emotional fallout hit as hard as the technique."
"Honestly, I didn’t expect to enjoy this one as much as I did. I’ve never been totally sold on Keanu as a powerhouse actor, but he really holds his own here, and it works. “The Devil’s Advocate” is a slick, entertaining thriller with a stacked cast that brings serious energy to every scene. The story keeps escalating in a way that’s wild but still easy to follow, and the visuals and atmosphere are surprisingly strong for its time. I’m also shocked the score isn’t higher—this movie goes for it and delivers. Definitely worth a watch. 9/10"
"This film definitely won’t click with everyone; if you need big plot twists or constant action, you’ll probably wonder why people rave about it. It takes an ordinary couple dynamic and compresses years of routine, petty arguments, and affection into a single day, all delivered with a perfectly flat, razor-dry sense of humor. The script is the real star—every line feels carefully timed, understated, and oddly satisfying. Side characters pop in just long enough to sharpen the satire, and the movie nails the small, familiar stereotypes without feeling mean. If you’re tuned into that vibe, it’s hilarious."
"The creature makeup and practical effects are a blast, and the plot holds together surprisingly well. The ensemble cast clicks, and most of the characters are easy to root for, even if a couple of their choices feel a little forced. What I liked most is how it balances tones: it genuinely made me laugh in spots, then turned around and got tense and creepy without warning. The pacing stays lively, with enough action to keep things moving while still sprinkling in a fun “who’s infected?” kind of suspense. The build-up to the big “queen” reveal is worth it—such a memorable design. If you enjoy alien takeover thrillers like Body Snatchers-style paranoia, this is a solid pick. 9/10."
"I’ve gone back to this series again and again, and it still makes me laugh out loud. I’m a longtime fan of the original show, but this follow-up feels a bit fresher to me, probably because I haven’t worn it out with endless rewatches. It builds nicely on the idea of the staff’s shared pension money and drops everyone into a new situation that creates plenty of chaos without losing the spirit of what came before. The newcomers fit in surprisingly well, with great comic timing and just the right amount of eccentricity. The actress playing Mavis is an absolute highlight, and Miss Lovelock steals scenes with her perfect deadpan. Mavis’s dad is also a riot. The country-house setting is gorgeous—honestly, I’d love a weekend there. My only complaint: there aren’t enough episodes."
"MANNY & LO (2 outta 5 stars)  
Not exactly terrible… just feels like it’s trying really hard to be quirky and heartfelt, then sort of forgets where it’s going. The setup is solid: two sisters with no adults to lean on hit the road to avoid getting split up by the system, and the older one’s pregnancy hangs over everything like a ticking clock. When they snatch a woman from a baby supply shop to help them figure out what to do, the movie shifts into this odd little hostage-turned-family scenario in a remote cabin.

There are moments that genuinely work, especially once the three start connecting in a way that’s more sad than cute. But the script leans on shocky language and random outbursts, and it undercuts what could’ve been a surprisingly tender story. The younger sister is played by a very young Scarlett Johansson, and she’s easily the most convincing person on screen. Mary Kay Place is also a strong anchor. Still, by the end it’s entertaining enough, just not very satisfying."
"Christopher Lambert and Christopher Lloyd turn up in an under-the-radar caper comedy where they play a pair of not-so-bright jewel thieves who snag the wrong gem and trigger absolute chaos. From there it’s one mistaken identity after another, with multiple shady factions converging to reclaim the stone, each more desperate than the last. The humor is mostly light and breezy, landing a few solid laughs without ever going for anything too edgy. What really sells it is the rapport between the leads: Lloyd is especially fun as the eccentric, seasoned crook, and Lambert proves he can handle comedic timing better than people give him credit for. That said, the script is uneven and some bits fall flat. Still, the finale ties things together nicely. 7/10."
"I honestly can’t believe I sat through this. I put it on expecting a halfway respectable gothic thriller, maybe even something that nodded to the big-name vampire and monster films it tries to resemble in the title and cover art. Nope. What I got was a bargain-bin creature feature that feels like it was assembled from leftover sets, stock music, and pure confidence.

The dialogue lands with a thud, and the actors deliver every line like they’re auditioning for a soap opera set inside a haunted museum. Scenes that should build tension instead drag on, stuffed with dramatic pauses and ominous staring. If anything could salvage this, it would be a commentary track by people who know how to turn cinematic disasters into entertainment—because unintentional comedy is the strongest element here.

The one moment I’ll remember is the big “reveal” of the ancient wrapped-up monster. The camera lingers like it’s showing off award-worthy makeup, and that’s when you notice the detail nobody bothered to fix: the hand looks… wrong. Not “uncanny,” just plainly incorrect, like the prop department grabbed whatever was closest and hoped no one would look too closely. I looked. Regrets."
"I don’t care how many people call this movie “essential” or “brilliant”—what’s on screen is indefensible. There’s an extended sequence where a clearly terrified cat is manhandled for minutes, tossed around, restrained, and then deliberately made to ingest something implied to be lethal. It isn’t quick, it isn’t implied off-camera, and it isn’t a trick of editing; the camera lingers while the animal goes limp. That alone should be enough to disqualify any talk of artistic merit.

What makes it even worse is that the cruelty is carried out by a young child performer. Watching a kid be directed to terrorize and potentially kill an animal for a shot is nauseating, and the movie treats it as just another scene.

If this had come from a celebrated Western auteur, it would be condemned without hesitation. The praise says more about critics than it does about the film."
"I’ve always had a soft spot for *Newsies*, and this DVD reminded me why it’s such a fun watch. It’s a family-friendly musical inspired by real events from the 1890s, and it manages to be both entertaining and surprisingly meaningful. If you enjoy big, energetic song-and-dance scenes, you’ll probably be hooked fast—the choreography is lively and the ensemble numbers have a lot of momentum. A few of the songs still get stuck in my head, especially the ones where the newsboys rally together and dream about something better.

Even if musicals aren’t usually your thing, there’s still plenty to appreciate. It gives a cleaned-up but effective glimpse of old New York and highlights how tough life could be for working kids, including themes like exploitation, poverty, and kids without families trying to get by. It’s also a classic “little guy vs. powerful tycoon” story, which makes it easy to root for the characters.

Not everything moves at the same pace—some of the boardroom-style scenes feel slower—but overall it’s a solid, rewatchable movie that can spark good conversations."
"Woody Allen’s *Shadows and Fog* feels less like a conventional movie and more like a stage farce dressed in moody, black‑and‑white Expressionist clothing. It borrows the look and anxious spirit of early German cinema, with echoes of Kafka-esque bureaucracy where everyone talks around the point. Allen plays a jittery everyman yanked out of bed by a self-important vigilante crowd and pushed into a manhunt with no clear instructions, which is where most of the humor lands. Meanwhile Mia Farrow’s weary circus performer drifts into her own misadventures, including an unexpectedly transactional romance that’s both funny and a little sad. The plot wanders and the ending doesn’t quite pay off, but the atmosphere and quick comic beats make it an enjoyable oddity. 7/10."
"This is easily one of the stronger Ernest outings. Jim Varney is in top form as Ernest P. Worrell, the well-meaning klutz who can’t help tripping into trouble, and his dynamic with Ron James as the long-suffering academic Abner is a big part of why it works. The story has a little more structure than some of the earlier movies: a forgotten piece of history turns out to be far more valuable than anyone expects, and suddenly Ernest and Abner are caught between shady criminals and an determined British operative who all want the same prize.

Even with the slightly higher-stakes plot, the comedy never disappears. The best moments come from the contrast between Abner trying to stay rational while Ernest goes full chaos mode. And yes, the cannon-related action bits are absurd in the best way. If you like Ernest at all, this one’s worth a watch."
"I went into this movie expecting something like a straightforward erotic drama, since the opening focuses on a woman stuck in a dead-end phone job and chasing increasingly risky thrills. Then it takes a hard turn into religious obsession. Mimi Rogers plays Sharon with this uneasy mix of sincerity and intensity, and her sudden fixation on finding “the Pearl” and leveling up spiritually becomes the engine of the plot. Before long she’s talking about the Trinity nonstop, pulling a husband and child into her new worldview, and heading off toward a desert-style end-times journey like she’s auditioning for a modern prophet.

At first I honestly wondered if I’d clicked on a zealot-themed sermon film, but the explicit scenes and the overall tone make it clear it’s aiming for something darker. The finale, especially, left me feeling like the message gets twisted into something disturbing rather than uplifting."
"After their parents die in a senseless accident, five brothers and sisters are forced to grow up fast and keep their household from falling apart. The oldest tries to act like a parent, the middle kids bounce between anger and responsibility, and the youngest ones carry the quiet weight of it all. What surprised me is how honestly the show tracks grief over time—messy, repetitive, and never neatly resolved. It’s basically a highly emotional teen drama, and once you’re hooked it’s hard to stop. The ensemble is strong, and it’s fun spotting actors who later became big names. Still, binging all the seasons can feel heavy; the constant turmoil really wears you down."
"Quelle aventure! This adaptation is a sweeping, larger-than-life tale, packed with betrayal, revenge, and just enough romance to keep your heart in a knot. A few of the hero’s identities stretch credibility, sure, but the lead actor carries it with such force and conviction that you stop caring and simply enjoy the ride. The European locations look gorgeous—stone corridors, sunlit coastlines, and grand interiors that make the whole thing feel lavish and real. Pacing is strong, with tension building nicely and hardly any slack scenes. The supporting cast adds texture and bite. One recommendation: watch it in the original French with subtitles. The dubbed track flattens the drama and steals the music of the language. Magnifique."
"The title alone pulled me in—I had to find out whether this movie would explode into something wild or just fizzle. Right from the start, watching Christian Slater wander into this worn, almost medieval-looking town, I felt that strange mix of danger and curiosity. His character arrives with a self-destructive edge, and the place seems determined to test him at every turn. He crosses paths with a stern clergyman, a chatty barber, a shrewd innkeeper, and more than a few temptations that push the romance (and the steam) up a notch. Then Robin Tunney shows up and brings a surprisingly tender, obsessive energy, especially in the candlelit bedroom scenes. Both leads commit hard, and it pays off. It’s messy, funny in spots, and unexpectedly emotional."
"Ignore the naysayers and give this film a fair shot—you might be surprised. Richard Dreyfuss doesn’t look like he’s coasting; he’s clearly enjoying himself and leaning into a lighter, funnier rhythm than his more serious roles. The script is sharp, and the jokes come from character and timing rather than loud, forced slapstick. What really sold me was the constant back-and-forth: little misunderstandings, confident bluffing, and quick one-liners that keep the pace moving. Even the physical comedy feels natural instead of thrown in. I found myself smiling through most of it. And keep an eye out for Mila Kunis popping up in a classroom bit—brief, but genuinely memorable."
"Where I’m from, people don’t turn every small misunderstanding into a full-on argument, so this series sometimes felt a bit exaggerated to me. It’s like everyone is constantly on edge, ready to explode instead of just taking a breath and talking normally. That said, I’m glad I stuck with it for one big reason: the way they handled the coming out storyline felt genuine and careful, not rushed or played for shock value. I didn’t exactly regret the time I spent watching, but I also kept going mostly because the Dawson/Joey tension kept pulling me into the next episode."
"I really enjoyed this series, but I’m baffled by how some sites handle the cast info. How do you spotlight a bunch of minor names and somehow bury the two leads everyone tuned in for? The whole reason my friends and I watched was for the chemistry between the main partners—one Black, one Latino—and the way they played off each other in every case. The supporting characters mattered too: the love interests, the tough female detective, and the recurring squad-room faces that made the precinct feel real. And let’s not pretend the guest appearances weren’t a draw; the show had some surprisingly big cameos that deserve credit. If you’re going to archive a series, at least get the basics right and give the standout cast their due."
"I know adapting a long, layered novel into a single film isn’t easy, but this version feels like it chose the safest, most predictable route. Scenes that should hit hard just pass by, and the cast never really made me care—when someone dies, I found myself thinking, “Wait, which one was that?” The plot moves, sure, but it’s more like a summary than a story with weight. If you want the richer, more detailed experience, I’d recommend finding an older mini-series adaptation instead. If you just want a straightforward period drama to fill an evening, it’s fine. Also, the historical setting matters—modern “fixes” don’t improve it, they blur the reality."
"Set among the manicured hallways of a top-tier Manhattan private school, this movie kicks off with two privileged step-siblings striking a nasty little bet: can they manipulate the new headmaster’s sheltered daughter (Reese Witherspoon) before the semester begins? If you came of age in the late ’90s, it’s hard not to feel how much this film stamped itself on that era. The cast is stacked with the “it” faces of the time, and watching them now is like opening a time capsule of glossy teen drama at its most shameless.

What I loved then—and still do—is how it wraps sharp humor around genuinely unsettling behavior. I didn’t realize for years it was based on earlier material, but that doesn’t diminish it. If anything, shifting the cruelty into adolescent hands makes it hit even harder."
"Going in I expected a light comedy, but this film isn’t really interested in easy laughs. It starts off almost ordinary, then drifts into increasingly strange territory until the finale snaps everything shut with a jolt that leaves you blinking at the credits. The trio at the center is what makes it work: the soft-spoken girlfriend who seems to shrink in every scene, the intimidating wife who fills the room, and the husband caught between them like a toy being tugged back and forth. The pacing is unhurried, yet it never stalls; each quiet moment adds pressure. Some of the twists may feel risqué, but the script builds them carefully enough that they don’t come off as random. With its single setting and tight cast, it plays like a tense chamber piece you have to sink into."
"From Hell is crafted with an impressive level of care, and the visuals are easily the standout. The foggy streets, gaslit interiors, and moody framing give it a rich, period-soaked atmosphere that feels more like a prestige thriller than a typical slasher. The film doesn’t always nail the mystery—its explanation of the killer can feel a bit too tidy and convenient—but the ride is still consistently engaging.

The cast is a big reason it works. The performances across the board are strong, and the movie takes time to make the victims feel like people rather than disposable shock material. The scenes with the women have a surprising amount of warmth and sadness, which makes the brutality hit harder without feeling exploitative. Johnny Depp anchors the story well and brings a haunted edge to his role, though his accent slips here and there.

Even at just under two hours, it rarely drags. If you’re into dark historical horror with style and substance, this is absolutely worth owning rather than just streaming once."
"I went into *The People vs. Larry Flynt* expecting a tasteless provocation, but what I got was a sharp, surprisingly human biopic that moves fast even when it’s trapped in hearings and appeals. The film tracks Flynt’s rough beginnings and his leap from hustling in clubs to pushing out a magazine designed to poke the establishment in the eye. One scandal in particular ignites the public outrage, and the story shifts into a long fight over speech, decency, and who gets to draw the line.

Woody Harrelson is magnetic—vulgar, funny, wounded, and stubborn in a way that makes him hard to dismiss even when you disagree with everything he stands for. Edward Norton brings calm intelligence as the attorney trying to keep the case grounded. Courtney Love is the surprise: raw and believable, not a gimmick. It’s messy material, but the movie finds a clear point beneath the grime."
"To me, *Thillu Mullu* ranks among Rajinikanth’s finest and easily one of Tamil cinema’s most enjoyable comedies. K. Balachander uses Rajini’s charm in a way that highlights his timing more than his usual swagger, and it works brilliantly. The real scene-stealer, though, is Thengai Srinivasan—his expressions and delivery lift every moment he’s in, making even simple situations hilarious. Sowcar Janaki also shines, proving she can handle comedy with effortless ease. Visu’s writing keeps the film lively and quotable, and M.S. Viswanathan’s songs and background score give the whole movie a cheerful drive. The surprise appearance near the end is a delightful bonus."
"Virus begins with a genuinely eerie setup: a strange disturbance in orbit coincides with a Russian research vessel suffering a catastrophic systems failure. When a salvage crew, led by Jamie Lee Curtis, stumbles across the drifting ship during a brutal storm, the premise practically writes itself—maritime salvage law, a floating prize, and the sense that something went terribly wrong onboard.

For a while, the atmosphere works. The corridors feel claustrophobic, the ship’s technology is unsettling, and the first signs that the crew isn’t alone are effectively creepy. Unfortunately, once the threat fully reveals itself, the film falls into a loop. It becomes a repetitive cycle of discovering another mechanical horror, scrambling through hallways, and regrouping, without much escalation or variation.

The characters rarely spark as a team, so the tension relies mostly on the creature effects. The finale arrives quickly and lands exactly where you expect. If you’re craving stronger cyborg sci-fi, you’ll likely enjoy other classics more."
"Calling this sequel a shadow of the first dino blockbuster is probably still being kind. It clearly wants to recapture that lightning-in-a-bottle sense of wonder and panic, but the plot lurches from set piece to set piece like the script was assembled during a helicopter ride. Goldblum’s Ian Malcolm is back in the spotlight, delivering his trademark sarcasm while stumbling through yet another “humans meddle, nature bites back” expedition—this time on a second island where everything is predictably out of control. There are a few genuinely tense stretches, and the bigger action moments are loud, goofy fun, but it never feels as sharp or tightly built as the original. Oddly, some of the best material feels borrowed from a different story. My favorite bit: the scrappy run-in with the small, nasty pack hunters. Overall: B-."
"I can see why some people hype this film up, especially anyone who’s into guns and nonstop action, but it really didn’t work for me. I found it dull between the shootouts, and when the violence hit, it was just way too much—constant gore and bodies piling up for shock value. None of the characters grabbed me either, so I didn’t care who lived or died. The director’s style is clearly “more blood, more chaos,” and maybe that’s the appeal, but it felt lazy instead of exciting. With a tighter story and less splatter, it could’ve been decent. Honestly, I’d pass and pick something else."
"I streamed this film on broadcast.com and came away with mixed feelings. There’s a genuinely interesting concept here, but the execution never fully comes together. You can tell it’s a shoestring production: the visuals look flat, lighting is uneven, and the editing feels choppy, as if key moments were cut out. The performances are fine—no one is terrible—but the script doesn’t give the cast much to work with. The story also struggles to connect its own dots; scenes happen, then the movie moves on without clear cause or payoff. The first and final minutes grab you, yet the middle drags. I’d rate it about 6/10."
"I keep wishing there were a little corner of the internet for the people who are absolutely obsessed with this film, because it scratches a very specific itch. If you’re the type who rolls your eyes at the loud, wink-at-the-camera baseball comedies, but you crave something quieter and more reverent, this is the one. It’s not about big speeches or tidy lessons—it’s about mood. The crack of the bat, the dusty light, the slow pauses between innings, and that feeling of stepping into a postcard from another era. I put it on when the house is empty and the night is warm, and it feels like the screen opens into a different decade. Plenty of movies chase that elusive “baseball poetry,” but this one actually lands it. If you understand, you understand."
"I liked a lot about this film, especially the acting. The cast brings real weight to every scene, and several performances feel lived-in rather than showy. For most of the runtime I was pulled along by the intersecting storylines, and I bought into the characters’ pain, confusion, and small moments of grace. The pacing is patient, but I didn’t mind because the emotional build was paying off.

Then the director makes a big stylistic pivot with an extended musical sequence. It’s clearly meant as a thematic bridge, a way to connect people who don’t share the same room, but it landed as heavy-handed for me. Watching characters suddenly “perform” yanked me out of the drama, and I started noticing the filmmaking choices instead of feeling the relationships.

After that, the movie still wraps up competently, but I never fully re-entered the spell. With a subtler approach, it might have been unforgettable."
"This film definitely isn’t flawless, but it’s a lot better than I expected. I had a genuinely fun time with it, especially thanks to the jokes that land more often than they miss. The cast carries the whole thing; even when the story starts stretching credibility and you can spot a few “wait, how did that happen?” moments, the performances keep you invested. There are a couple weak spots I won’t describe because they edge into spoiler territory, but the pacing dips here and there and the plot doesn’t always connect cleanly. Still, there are several standout scenes that made the ticket feel worth it. If you’re looking for an entertaining watch rather than a perfectly tight script, this one delivers. I’d watch it again. 6/10"
"He isn’t a slick action hero, and he sure doesn’t glide through problems with charm or genius. The lead in “Ledger Line” is stubborn, reactive, and prone to charging into a mess before he’s figured out the rules—then scrambling to patch things up after the damage is done. He’ll admit he was wrong when he’s cornered, but pride keeps him from easy apologies, and the story doesn’t hand him neat victories. The hook here is that he’s an auditor for a government agency, not a cop, and his paper trail investigation drags him straight into a tight-knit criminal scheme. The movie plays it fairly straight, but it’s grounded, tense enough, and a solid pick if you want a no-frills crime thriller."
"After enjoying “The Scarlet Dove,” I went looking for more early Finnish noir and found “Hän Varasti Elämän” (1962), directed by Arne Taarkas. It’s a grim, tightly wound crime story with a terrific lead performance from Risto Mäkelä. He plays a small-time man with a big lie: after a desperate act during a payroll run, he slips into a dead stranger’s identity and escapes with the money. What follows is the unsettling part—how quickly a new town can embrace him as a respectable figure, as if charm and cash erase everything.

The movie looks great for its era, with convincingly lived-in locations and a steady, shadowy mood. Mäkelä sells both the panic and the cold calculation. The ending is startling and bleak, and the flirtatious scenes with the maid feel surprisingly bold for the period."
"I hate to be the odd one out, but I didn’t connect with this movie the way so many people seem to. For a story that’s meant to feel heartfelt and lived-in, it struck me as overly polished, like it was recreating the past from a studio backlot rather than from memory. The small-town atmosphere was there in theory, yet the details felt arranged to tug at you instead of unfolding naturally. A lot of the scenes depended on coincidences and big “moment” speeches, and that made it hard for me to believe the characters were real people rather than vehicles for a message.

I went in hoping for something with the quiet, messy truth you find in the best coming-of-age films. Instead, it leaned heavily into nostalgia and sentiment. I’m sure it will work for others, but it left me cold."
"There’s a little extra snap to “The Last Deadline” that sets it apart from the usual mismatched-partners action formula. You’ve seen the cynical detective paired with someone out of their depth a hundred times, but making the second lead a reputation-obsessed true-crime podcaster adds a fun layer of media commentary. The cop character is a walking fuse box, and the actor nails that simmering impatience without turning it into parody. Meanwhile, the podcaster’s frantic enthusiasm plays perfectly against him, keeping the banter sharp. The plot stays on track, the set pieces move with real momentum, and the self-aware jokes land more often than not. 7/10"
"I’ve always had a soft spot for this film. It’s one of the rare horror titles I can enjoy without feeling tense the whole time, and I actually like how this version wraps things up more than the earlier one. I read the novel it came from, and it’s honestly impressive how rewatchable the movie is—I’ve put it on multiple times and it still holds my attention.

What really makes it work for me is David. He feels different from the other strange kids in a way that isn’t just “creepy,” but genuinely interesting. He comes across as someone who can sense what others are feeling, and that touch of compassion makes him stand out. The story also does a great job showing why he ends up being seen as an outsider; it’s not random, it’s tied to what happened to the person he was meant to be connected with. For me, it’s a surprisingly heartfelt movie, and I can’t think of any real complaints."
"Honestly, I can’t believe this movie made it out of editing. I’m only writing this because I feel a moral obligation to warn people before they waste an evening they’ll never get back. It’s painfully dull, the jokes land with a thud, and the whole thing feels like a bad sketch stretched way past its limits. I kept waiting for it to pick up, or at least make sense, and it just… doesn’t. The plot is a mess, the pacing drags like crazy, and when it finally ends you’re left wondering why you didn’t just stare at a blank wall instead. Also, if you’re watching for Jennifer Love Hewitt, don’t bother—she’s barely there. I recommended it as a joke to a friend and now I’m paying for it. Please skip it."
"Even with big names on the poster, this one really lives or dies on its writing, and the script is what makes it work. It plays like a behind-the-scenes political drama that suddenly remembers it’s also a sweet, slightly idealized romance—and that blend totally clicks for me. The lead isn’t treated as a marble statue; he’s allowed to be funny, stubborn, and awkward, while the movie still respects the weight of the job. It’s surprisingly earnest without feeling corny, with little bursts of cynicism to keep it grounded. The score and speechy moments hit the emotional beats at the right times, and by the end I was fully invested. Solid 7/10."
"Packed with a cast most filmmakers would kill for without needing blockbuster money, this movie hits the ground running and never really lets up. Matt Damon carries the story with an easy confidence, and Ben Affleck brings a rough-edged charm that makes their friendship feel lived-in. The supporting players are the real fireworks, though: both Martin Landau and Edward Norton grab every scene they’re given and remind you why they’ve been celebrated for years. Then there’s John Malkovich, who turns what could’ve been a stock villain into something hypnotic and unsettling. Add Famke Janssen’s presence and you’ve got a film that’s slick, tense, and endlessly watchable."
"I’ll admit, Jim Carrey used to crack me up when I was younger. I remember renting this movie nonstop around middle school and thinking every goofy face and loud joke was pure comedy gold. Watching it again now as an adult, it doesn’t hit the same way. A lot of the humor feels like it’s aimed at kids who will laugh just because it’s weird or over-the-top, and that’s not really my taste anymore.

That said, Carrey still has a ton of energy, and you can see why he became such a big deal. Even when the jokes fall flat, his timing and commitment are solid. I still enjoy a few scenes out of pure nostalgia, but overall I find myself more annoyed than entertained.

If you grew up loving it, you might still have fun. If you’re expecting clever comedy, you’ll probably be disappointed."
"If you want a light, entertaining time-waster, Rush Hour delivers. The set pieces are the main attraction—Jackie Chan’s choreography is sharp and creative, and the stunts keep things moving even when the plot is basically an excuse to jump to the next brawl. Chris Tucker’s nonstop energy keeps the whole thing from feeling too stiff, which helps because the story isn’t meant to be taken as anything more than a playful setup. Neither guy would carry this kind of movie as well on his own, but together the chemistry clicks. Solid buddy-action fun. 7/10."
"Rab C Nesbitt is one of those comedies that never got the credit it deserved, and I’m glad the early series finally found their way onto DVD. I picked up Series 1 after hearing people talk about it for years, then ended up tracking down the rest and now I’ve got up to Series 5. It’s a shame it took so long for a classic like this to be properly available, because it still feels sharp and relevant.  

The setup is simple: a hard-drinking Glaswegian who thinks he’s got all the answers, taking aim at politics and everyday hypocrisy. Despite what some say, you don’t need a translator to enjoy it. The later episodes aren’t quite the same after Eric Cullen passed away, but the heart of the show is still there. A proper must-watch."
"A lot of folks seem to bash this film without even giving it a chance, which is a shame because it’s actually a solid watch. It’s not going to win any big awards, but for an action/sci‑fi flick it delivers more than you’d expect. Kurt Russell does a surprisingly good job with very little dialogue—most of what he’s feeling comes through in his face and body language. The opening hooked me right away and had a creepy, tense vibe. The finale isn’t perfect and feels a bit rushed, yet the story still felt fresh instead of copying other movies. The lead changes gradually in an interesting way. If you like gritty sci‑fi, it’s worth a rental."
"If you approach *Clubbed to Death* as a pure slice of “cinema du look,” it’s hard not to admire how confidently it paints with shadow, neon, and cigarette haze. The imagery does a lot of heavy lifting, because the narrative is almost comically thin—more a sketch than a plot, and it strains to justify even its brisk runtime. Still, the film nails that damp basement-club energy that defined mid‑90s dance culture, and the soundtrack is the real hook: cool, propulsive, and curated with obvious affection for the scene (with big-name electronic cuts that keep the pulse alive). Performances feel intentionally detached, like everyone’s half-awake under strobe lights. Flawed, but oddly hypnotic."
"Steve Brooks is a slick advertising hotshot who treats every woman in his orbit like a disposable accessory. After one too many betrayals, a few of his exes decide the world would be better off without him—and the afterlife agrees. He gets bounced back to Earth with a ridiculous “redemption” assignment: find someone who genuinely cares about him. Of course, there’s a catch. The Devil meddles and Steve returns as Amanda, forced to navigate the same city and workplace from the other side of the gender divide, while pretending to be his own relative. Meanwhile, his longtime buddy Walter starts falling for “Amanda,” which adds an extra layer of awkwardness.

The concept is bold and there are moments that land, especially when the story finally admits Steve’s real problem isn’t anatomy, it’s empathy. Still, the comedy often feels like it’s coasting on the gender-swap alone. Barkin has presence, but the material begs for sharper physical timing and stronger satirical bite. The ending, however, is surprisingly satisfying."
"I caught *Life* for the first time during a random channel flip and it honestly took me off guard—in a good way. Going in, I assumed it would lean hard on loud, edgy jokes, especially with Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence front and center. Instead, it plays more like a comedy with real weight to it, and the emotional beats land better than I expected.

There’s definitely some rough language (you can tell when a TV edit is patching things up), but it never feels like the movie is relying on profanity to be funny. The humor comes more from the situations and the chemistry between the leads, and that makes the quieter moments hit even harder.

If you’re looking for something that’s entertaining without being nonstop crude, this is an easy pick for a relaxed movie night. Even if you’re not a die-hard fan of either actor, the story pulls you in. The ending left me smiling. 3.5/5"
"I happened to catch this film late one night while channel surfing, and I didn’t expect a quiet cavalry drama to stick with me the way it did. What hit hardest was the sense of an era ending—men who built their whole identity around horses and tradition suddenly being told the future belonged to engines and steel. The story makes you picture what that transition felt like on a personal level, not just a military one: pride mixed with uncertainty, and a nagging feeling of being left behind.

Afterward I realized I couldn’t even remember the title, which sent me down a rabbit hole trying to figure out how much of the plot had roots in real events. I looked up articles on the U.S. Army’s shift toward mechanization and skimmed a few academic papers to get the timeline straight. When I finally tracked the movie down again online, I was honestly relieved—having cast info, production notes, and summaries all in one place helped connect the dots.

If anyone knows whether the main characters were based on real officers or units, I’d love to learn more."
"I went into Romeo Must Die with pretty low expectations, and it ended up being a lot more fun than I’d anticipated. The plot doesn’t break any new ground, but the cast and the action keep things moving. Aaliyah comes across effortlessly on screen, and her scenes with Jet Li have an easy, believable spark. Li is the real draw here—his speed and precision are impressive, and he brings a likable sense of humor that makes the quieter moments work too. The supporting roles help round it out, with Delroy Lindo in particular bringing extra energy and presence whenever he shows up. My main gripe is that some of the fights lean on flashy visual tricks when Li’s physical ability could have carried the impact on its own. Still, the stylized X-ray-style hits are pretty memorable. Solid entertainment: 8/10."
"At first glance, Porco Rosso feels like a breezy, beautifully drawn romp through sunlit skies and Adriatic waters, the kind of film you could watch just for the planes, the banter, and the sense of old-fashioned adventure. But the longer it lingers, the more you notice the weight beneath the charm. There’s a quiet bitterness in the way it looks at heroism, and an unease about the political winds gathering off-screen. It reminds me of how some of Miyazaki’s lighter capers still carry a bruise at their center—only here the bruise isn’t hidden. I’m surprised this one doesn’t come up more often. Maybe it’s the weary, older lead, the grounded historical backdrop, or the fact that the magic is mostly emotional rather than mystical. Either way, it deserves more attention."
"This is one of those movies you can throw on and immediately relax into. The three main guys play off each other really well, and the casting for their younger selves mostly works too. The story stays straightforward: Roland is hours away from walking down the aisle, panics, and ends up at an ex’s place instead of the venue. His friends Mike and Slim race over to drag him back, and along the way Mike’s voiceover fills in how their friendship started and why they’re so tight.

What I liked is that the leads feel like actual people—funny, flawed, and still easy to root for—rather than stock “groom jitters” characters. I do wish the script dug a little deeper into Roland’s doubts, because they’re hinted at more than explored. Also, one of the “younger” casting choices didn’t quite sell the age difference.

Still, it’s upbeat, the 80s music is a blast, and the jokes land without leaning on tired clichés. Solid 7/10."
"I ended up really enjoying this film from start to finish. The performances feel lived-in, the casting makes sense, and the writing strikes a great balance between laugh-out-loud moments and scenes that land with genuine weight. What impressed me most is how it handles a subject that still makes some audiences uneasy without turning it into a lecture or a melodrama.

I’ve watched other movies centered on gay relationships that leaned too hard on clichés or made every conflict about society’s cruelty. This one felt more grounded. The characters aren’t reduced to labels; they’re just people trying to navigate dating, fear, loyalty, and the messiness that comes with wanting someone while also protecting yourself. Even as a straight viewer, I found a lot of the relationship anxieties familiar, and the more specific struggles were presented in a way that made them understandable rather than sensational.

Spoiler-ish note: by the end, I was fully invested in seeing two men choose each other. That’s a first for me, and it’s because the movie earned it."
"Donald Duck has been a comfort character for me since I was little, so I couldn’t resist checking out *The New Spirit*. The central idea is definitely a product of its era, and some of the messaging lands a bit awkwardly today, but there’s still a lot here to admire. Visually it’s terrific: bold colours, crisp drawing, and a surprising amount of detail in the backgrounds. A few of the more militaristic sequences are genuinely intense for a short cartoon, which makes the lighter opening moments feel like a smart contrast rather than a tonal mismatch. The music is bright and memorable, and the film’s standout stretch is the dreamlike segment where everyday office tools suddenly become animated in a way that’s oddly hypnotic. Donald’s energy is spot-on—eager, then gradually less certain—and that arc sells the whole thing. Overall, a well-crafted short that’s compelling even if its viewpoint feels dated. 8/10"
"This movie stands out in a way that’s hard to describe until you’ve sat through it. From the first few scenes, the cinematography feels slightly off-kilter in the best possible sense, and the music isn’t just background noise—it shapes the mood and keeps you uneasy even when nothing “big” is happening. The setting and era also give it a distinct identity; it doesn’t feel like it’s borrowing the usual beats from other films in the genre.

What I enjoyed most is how the story keeps shifting just as you think you’ve figured out the rules. It feeds you enough to stay invested, but never so much that you feel comfortable. Each sequence adds some new angle or detail that changes how you read what came before, and that push-and-pull made it genuinely absorbing.

Long after it ended, I caught myself replaying certain moments and wondering what I’d missed. It’s one of those rare films that lingers because it refuses to be neatly summarized, and the direction holds all those strange elements together with confidence."
"I used to look forward to this series. It had a real spark back in the day, and for a while it even felt like it found its footing again in the early 2000s. But for the last decade it’s been a slow, stubborn slide downhill, and at this point it feels like the network is keeping it alive out of habit rather than any creative reason.

The jokes rarely land anymore, and the sketches feel recycled and oddly dated, like they’re chasing trends that passed years ago. The newer performers aren’t terrible, but they don’t have the timing or chemistry that made the older seasons work, and the writing comes off lazy and predictable.

What frustrates me most is how much this run has dulled the memory of what the show once was. It should’ve ended on a high note instead of limping along season after season."
"This film comes across like a promising draft rather than a fully formed story. I kept wishing it had more time to breathe, because the core idea is genuinely moving and a little offbeat. It captures those early college days with surprising honesty: arriving in a huge city, not knowing anyone, and realizing how quickly people can be cold, transactional, or simply too busy to care. I ended up rooting hard for the main character—she’s upbeat and timid at once, trying to be kind while getting quietly worn down by the new surroundings. The actress nails that fragile, endearing energy without overplaying it. There are a few moments that really stick, the kind this director is especially good at creating."
"This movie turned out to be a real shot of adrenaline. It’s a tense military thriller with slick effects and a pace that rarely lets up. A cocky Navy navigator pushes his more cautious pilot into a risky flight over forbidden airspace, and once they’re hit and forced down behind enemy lines, the story becomes a brutal race against time. Back at base, their commander wants to act fast but keeps running into political roadblocks, which only cranks up the frustration. Meanwhile, a ruthless officer on the ground takes things personally and hunts the surviving crewman with frightening intensity. Strong supporting cast, solid suspense, and plenty of edge-of-your-seat moments."
"Most of the screen time is still carried by the pets and their celebrity voice work, while the human characters feel like background scenery. The story leans on the familiar “separated from home and forced to navigate a big city” setup, which is comforting but also pretty predictable if you’ve seen the first film. I didn’t think this follow-up matched the charm of the earlier adventure, mainly because it lingers too long on the budding dog romance and not enough on the possibilities of the San Francisco setting. With a title like this, I expected more lively set pieces and more movement through different neighborhoods, but the pacing stalls when the animals settle in one place for stretches.

That said, the banter is still the main draw. The dog and cat get plenty of snappy one-liners, and a surprising number of jokes are aimed over kids’ heads in a fun way. I also appreciated that the movie avoids heavy-handed villains or mean-spirited threats. Overall, it’s a decent, light sequel—pleasant, but not memorable."
