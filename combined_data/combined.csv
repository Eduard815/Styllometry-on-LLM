"Danny De Bie (born 23 January 1960) is a former Belgian professional cyclist and directeur sportif, who won the men's race at the 1989 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships. His brothers Eddy De Bie and Rudy De Bie also competed professionally. Career Born in Beersel, De Bie achieved several successes on the road but started to focus on cyclo-cross full-time after taking the silver medal at the 1987 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships. He went to Switzerland which was at that time the main place for cyclo-cross races. Two years later he achieved that. The World Cyclo-Cross Championships parcours at Pont-Château in 1989, was a course that was suited to him. De Bie was able to cycle up a tough climb of almost 100 metres where his opponents such as Adri van der Poel had to walk and as a result De Bie was able to make a gap every time he went over the climb. After winning the rainbow jersey, De Bie became one of the best cyclo crossers of the world with a win in the Superprestige classification and increased popularity for the sport in Belgium. In 1991 De Bie was suspected of possible tampering with a doping control after a Superprestige race in Zillebeke and he was not allowed to take part in the World Championships that year in Gieten. De Bie was Belgium cyclo-cross champion for three years in a row and then beaten by Paul Herijgers. De Bie in his career won 11 Superprestige races. After his career he worked as directeur sportif for the team between 2000 and 2014, and in 2015.

"Mezek () is a village in southeastern Bulgaria, part of Svilengrad municipality, Haskovo Province. It lies at the foot of the eastern Rhodope Mountains, just north of the Bulgaria–Greece border and not far west of the Bulgaria–Turkey border. Mezek is famous for the well-preserved medieval Mezek Fortress (Neoutzikon - Νεούτζικον) and its two ancient Thracian beehive tombs, the Mezek and Sheynovets tombs. The village is also well known for its own winery and the Mezzek brand of Bulgarian wine. Fortress and Tomb The Mezek Fortress, in area, is claimed to be among the best preserved Bulgarian medieval castles. It dates to the 11th century. Along with the Thracian tombs, it was studied by a team under archaeologist Bogdan Filov in 1931–1932. The castle has nine towers, five of which lie at the vulnerable south wall. The Mezek Fortress was built out of stone, with two decorative lines of bricks on the outside. It suffered some destruction around 1900, when stones from the fortress were used for the construction of Ottoman barracks in Svilengrad. The Mezek Thracian tomb dates to the 4th century BC. It is a large, elongated tomb that includes a covered passage of , two rectangular antechambers of different size and a round burial chamber with a stone sarcophagus. The number of burials of noble Thracians in the tomb was no less than four. Gold, silver, bronze, iron and glass items and pottery discovered in the tomb are today displayed in the National Archaeological Museum in Sofia. Nature There is an eco-trail Sheynovets peak starting at the center of the village. It's 7 km in length and requires around 6 hours for a return trip.

"Eulace Peacock (August 27, 1914 – December 13, 1996) was an American track and field athlete in the 1930s. Peacock was born in Dothan, Alabama and raised in the Vauxhall section of Union Township, New Jersey, where he graduated from Union High School in 1933. He set the New Jersey high school record in 1933 with a long jump of that was on the books for 44 years until Renaldo Nehemiah had a jump measured at He became a rival to Jesse Owens in many sprinting competitions. He broke the high school record in the long jump the same day it was bettered by Owens. ""I had that record for two hours."" He attended Temple University in Philadelphia where he became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Peacock won the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) outdoor pentathlon championship six times, in 1934, 1935, 1937, and from 1943 through 1945. He was a sprinting prodigy, who bested the notable prodigy of his time, Owens, on several occasions. A victory by Peacock over Owens in a July 1935 meet in Lincoln, Nebraska led The New York Times to say that ""Peacock's star still is in the ascendancy"" under the headline ""Peacock's Victories Over Owens Project Duel for Olympic Fame"" After pulling a hamstring muscle, he was unable to qualify for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany. In 1942 he served in the United States Coast Guard; in later years he opened a liquor store and a car-rental business. He stayed connected with athletics by officiating at championship events and Olympic qualifying trials.

"Agnes ""Nan"" Paterson Hardie (5 October 1885 – 27 June 1947) was a Scottish labour movement activist. Life Hardie was born in Cumnock in Ayrshire, Hardie was the daughter of Keir and Lilian Hardie. Hardie was then a prominent mining trade unionist, and he later became the first leader of the Labour Party. Keir believed that Nan would be his political heir, and spent a large amount of time discussing politics with her, and introduced her to other leading figures in the movement; notably, John Bruce Glasier, with whom she retained a long-term friendship. Nan left school at the age of fourteen but, three years later, became seriously ill, suffering from pleurisy and appendicitis; although she recovered, she suffered with poor health for the remainder of her life. She accompanied her father on many speaking trips, including one to Nova Scotia in 1912, until 1915 when he became ill; Nan and her mother looked after him until he died, later in the year. In 1924, Hardie married Emrys Hughes, a socialist journalist, and she spent much of the next decade assisting him in his journalistic and political career. In 1933, she herself was elected to Cumnock Town Council, on which she served as convenor of the Public Health Committee. In 1935, she succeeded her husband as provost, and the two together waged a long campaign for slum clearance and their replacement with council housing. This was massively successful, and by 1939, three-quarters of the town's population lived in council houses. Hardie took a particular interest in children's activities, founding a park and lido in the town, and also promoted cycling. She was appointed as a magistrate, and during World War II chaired the Cumnock War Work Party; although, like her husband, she opposed the conflict, she was keen to assist in the welfare of those serving in the force and their dependents. In 1946, Hughes became seriously ill, and Hardie tried to resign as provost. Instead, the council persuaded her to take a leave of absence, but the process of caring for him damaged her own health, and she died in June 1947.

"A clearance car is a type of railroad car in maintenance of way service. Its purpose is to check the clearances around the tracks and ensure that trains conforming to the railroad's standard loading gauge or dynamic envelope will not encounter any obstruction. Additionally, by measuring the actual clearances along a route, the railroad can determine whether outsize loads can be accommodated along that route, and the largest size feasible. Design Early clearance cars simply consisted of an outline of the system loading gauge attached to a railroad car, which would be towed along the route to ensure the clearances were still sufficient. Later clearance cars functioned by using physical feelers—rods which extended from the car in all directions which would be deflected back by obstructions. These would be connected to instrumentation which displayed the actual clearance at that point. These feelers have an advantage in that they bounce back and do not break if they do hit something. Subsequently, clearance cars using lasers for measurement have come into service. These are generally HiRail trucks – road vehicles with supplemental rail wheels. Benefits The clearance car allowed accurate and speedy measurement of the clearances for a structure. Generally they were only owned by larger railroads; other railroads sometimes leased them for short periods. Some were self-propelled, while others were locomotive-hauled.

"Pauline Vanier Park is a public park in Ottawa's Riverside Park area, located on Harkness Avenue. It is named after Pauline Vanier. The park was built in the early 1960s on what had been the Munro farm, next to neighbouring General Vanier Public School. The Riverside Park Community and Recreation Association organized fireworks displays for over twenty years until changes in safety legislation required its removal to a larger area. Sheldon Ridgeway, then an Ottawa firefighter, started the public activity. After a six-year gap, the fireworks display was moved to Mooney's Bay in 2015. Facilities The park has swings and play structures for children as well as a wading pool. The city of Ottawa operates and staffs the wading pool during the summer season. The pool is not fenced. It is filled during the day and supervised by lifeguards. In the evenings, the pool is drained prior to staff leaving. The park field house is used by the lifeguards as an office and to store supplies. The field house was one of six field houses built at the same time by the City of Ottawa in 1967. The park also has two baseball diamonds with back stops, and one t-ball diamond. In the winter, a temporary skating rink, with boards, is set up in the park. The field house is used as a change room for skaters. Volunteers from the Riverside Park Community and Recreation Association take care of the ice during the season.

"The Castillo de San José (Castle of San José) is an historic fortress and art museum in Arrecife on the Canary Island of Lanzarote. History Built between 1776 and 1779 the fort was constructed to provide a defensive stronghold in case of pirate attacks, and as a public works project to provide much needed employment during a time of famine and poverty on the island. It became commonly known as the Fortress of Hunger (Fortaleza del hambre). The famine was caused by a number of factors including periods of drought, and the earlier eruption of Timanfaya between 1730 and 1736, which devastated most of the productive agricultural areas on the island. Charles III of Spain, who was concerned for the plight of the islanders, ordered that the fortress be built. Situated on a cliff above the Port of Naos, the D shaped fort has semi-circular walls facing the sea. On the landward side, the rear wall is protected by two small turrets, with a moat crossed by a lifting drawbridge leading to the main gateway. The fortress is constructed of masonry and ashlar blocks of volcanic origin. The interior which is made up of barrel vaulted rooms was mainly used as a powder store. International Museum of Contemporary Art In the 1970s the fortress was renovated and the interior redesigned by the artist César Manrique, who was born nearby, to house a museum of modern art. The museum opened to the public in 1976 as the International Museum of Contemporary Art (, abbreviated as MIAC). The exhibits are primarily from the period between 1950 and 1980, with a focus on various abstract art forms, such as modern sculpture, kinetic art, and geometric abstraction. The works are mainly by Spanish artists including Joan Miró, Antoni Tàpies, Eusebio Sempere and the El Paso group, one section is also dedicated to the Canarian artist Pancho Lasso. The courtyard is also used as a display space for outdoor sculptures and designs. Beneath the museum, the annexe of the fort was renovated and converted into a restaurant, the two connected by a spiral staircase. With curved floor to ceiling windows, the dining room has panoramic views overlooking the harbour and docks below.

"Ashburn Alley is the open concourse behind center field at Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies. It is named after Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn, Phillies center fielder from 1948 to 1959, and was also a long time broadcaster for the Phillies from 1963 until his death in September 1997. Ashburn Alley spans from the left field gate to ""The Yard"" kids area, and features a ""street-fair"" like atmosphere before and during a game. Ashburn Alley's name sake began while Ashburn was still playing. During the Phillies playing days at old Shibe Park, Ashburn was known for dropping bunts down the third baseline, which had slightly overgrown grass that helped the ball stay fair. A bronze statue of Ashburn lies in the center of the alley. Features Ashburn Alley serves as a history lesson of baseball in Philadelphia. Granite markers on the walk-way feature every Phillies all-star since the first game in 1933. Another feature of Ashburn Alley is Memory Lane. Memory Lane is located directly behind the batter's eye, and gives an extensive look at the history of Philadelphia baseball. It features the history of the Phillies, the history of Philadelphia Athletics, and history of Negro league teams in the city. At the end of the Memory Lane section offers a great view of the stadiums' two tiered bullpen. The upper bullpen, in particular, pulls snug against the concourse. On the western end of the Alley is Bull's BBQ, named after former Phillies slugger Greg ""The Bull"" Luzinski, who also operates it. Bull's BBQ is an outdoor picnic section and serves barbecue pork sandwiches, chicken, and most notably ribs. Luzinski is at most of the games and often socializes with fans. On top of the concession buildings in the center of the Alley is the Rooftop Bleachers. This area of the stadium was influenced by the old rooftop seats at the Phillies and Athletics old home Shibe Park. It was common during the 1920s for residents who lived in the rowhouses across from the ballpark to watch the games for free on their rooftops. There are many concession stands featuring Philadelphia cuisine staples such as the cheesesteak, at both Tony Luke's and Campo's. The Alley also features the '47 Brand store, which sells classic Phillies apparel, classic pennants and banners, and other items.

The story raises the subject of surveillance, particularly the feeling of paranoia, self-doubt, and the disturbances it causes in everyday life; symptoms of fear and nervousness, such as unrest, sleeplessness, weight-loss, and hair-loss. Her daily routine is shaped around this surveillance. She trusts no one and suspects everyone. No conversation can be held within her apartment without the telephone jack being pulled to prevent calls from having unwanted listeners. Telephone calls are a façade, where only code words and petty banter take place. She becomes obsessed with her observers. Who are they? Who sent them? Do they have normal lives? Are they normal people outside their jobs? As a first-person narrative, the reader is transported into the author's inner monologue and introspection. By the end of the story she is very much influenced by the guests at her manuscript reading, young adults by whom the establishment feels threatened and remove by force. The main character realizes that the youth are watching and writing everything down. There is hope and one day she will be able to speak of this time and her experiences freely. And she realizes that perhaps ""they"" are right in distrusting her. 1990 German novels Novels set during the Cold War East German novels Novels by Christa Wolf Works about the Stasi",human,informative
"Carved elephant tusk depicting Buddha life stories is an intricately carved complete single tusk now exhibited at the Decorative Arts gallery, National Museum, New Delhi, India. This tusk was donated to the Museum. This tusk, which is nearly five foot long, illustrates forty three events in the life of the Buddha and is thought to have been made by early 20th century craftsmen from the Delhi region. Description The use of the complete ivory tusks for carving was popular in 18th and 19th century India, particularly in the Delhi region apart from Burma. Similar whole tusk carvings are also found in the Ivory Coast, Congo and Benin but made from the tusks of African elephants. The art of ivory carving in India is very ancient with references found in Kalidasa's Meghadūta. The earliest ivory carving from the Indian region is comb dating to the 2nd century CE found at Taxila. Ivory carving flourished in Assam and Mysore where elephants were available and the art of ivory carving had royal patronage. Ivory was an object of trade between kingdoms and they found their way into areas where the art of carving had patronage. This ivory tusk illustrates important life events of Buddha in 43 circular roundel, first 25 referring to the story of Buddha's birth to his enlightenment followed by 18 depicting his life events from enlightenment to Mahaparinirvana. Similar scenes have been presented in sculptures and paintings many a times but this ivory tusk shows few new scenes of Buddha's life such as Siddharatha's fight for a bird, his move against animal sacrifice and realization of death. As the thickness of the tusk reduces upwards, one can see at the tip three well-known postures depicting Bhumisparsha mudra, Abhayamudra and Dharmachakrapravatan mudra besides the roundels. There is also an intricately carved floral creeper banding around the roundels enhancing its beauty. Scenes The story runs from bottom to top and is arranged clockwise.

"The Washington Road Elm Allée is a stretch of Washington Road in West Windsor, New Jersey that is lined with Princeton Elm trees. The allée runs through the West Windsor fields of Princeton University and provides, along with the bridge over Lake Carnegie, a dramatic entrance to the campus. The Delaware and Raritan Canal can be found at the northern end of the allée, just before the lake. A jogging path runs through the allée and connects to the canal towpath, the main campus of the university, and other trails through the adjacent fields. History Elm Allée The original allée was planted in the mid-1920s by Princeton Nurseries, at one time the country's largest commercial plant nursery. The Elm trees are of the Princeton variety, developed by Princeton Nurseries for its landscaping quality, and are resistant to Dutch elm disease, the only one of ten resistant cultivars to have trees that have reached maturity. Of the original 136 Elms planted in the 1920s only 76 survive. They are approximately in diameter and tall. Their branches meet over the roadway to provide a leafy canopy. The allée has many replacement trees, including 16 Norway maples planted in the 1960s, and 31 Liberty elms planted in 1995. The secondary rows of Delaware Elms were planted in 1983, and a long row of forsythia to the east is thought to date from the late 1960s. Schenck-Covenhoven Burial Ground To the east of the Elm Allée, from the road, along the jogging path, can be found the Schenck-Covenhoven Burial Ground, sometimes called the Old Conover Graveyard. It contains forty or fifty graves surrounded by a stone wall and is undoubtedly the oldest cemetery in West Windsor Township, with burials dating to at least 1751. The Schenck and Covenhoven families were Dutch farmers who purchased in what is now West Windsor from William Penn in 1737. The Conover family was among the original settlers in Penns Neck, a settlement found at the south end of the allée. The cemetery has been in disuse for more than a century, though it receives some maintenance from the university.

"Willy Haas (6 July 1891 – 4 September 1973) was a German editor, film critic, and screenwriter. He wrote for 19 films between 1922 and 1933, and was a member of the jury at the 8th Berlin International Film Festival. Biography Willy Haas was the son of a Jewish lawyer. He studied law himself, and at a young age joined a literary circle with his friends Franz Werfel, Paul Kornfeld and Johannes Urzidil. He had personal contacts with Franz Kafka and Max Brod. This circle, which met in Prague at the Café Arco, also included Ernst Polak, the husband of Milena Jesenská. From 1911 to 1912 in Prague, the press of the Johann Gottfried Herder Association published the Herder-Blätter (Literary Journal of the Herder Association), whose editors were Willy Haas and Norbert Eisler. The journal published several essays by Haas. For the last two issues (# 4 and # 5), Otto Pick was involved. The Herder-Blätter published the work of many literary authors for the first time. After World War I Haas went to Berlin, where he did editorial work and also worked as a screenwriter and film critic. Together with Ernst Rowohlt, he founded the weekly Die literarische Welt in 1925. When his apartment in Berlin was repeatedly searched in 1933, he emigrated to Prague, where he worked as a newspaper editor. The literary magazine Welt im Wort (World in the Word), founded by Haas in Prague, soon ceased publication for financial reasons. After the German occupation of Prague in 1939, he went first to Italy and from there to India, where he worked as a screenwriter for at least two Indian films by Mohan Bhavnani. He also earned a salary as a censor for the British army in India. In 1948 he returned to Germany and lived in Hamburg. There he wrote for Die Welt and Welt am Sonntag, as well as for other magazines and newspapers. Haas was married three times: from 1921-1925 with the translator Jarmila Ambrozova, from 1925 to 1936 with Hanna Waldeck (who gave birth to their son in 1925), and from 1947 with Herta Doctor.

"Heathfield Park is an English country house and walled park in the village of Old Heathfield in East Sussex. History Originally called Bayley Park, the mansion was begun by James Plummer in 1677 and continued by Raymond Blackmore in the early eighteenth century. George Augustus Eliott (created Lord Heathfield in 1787) purchased the property after gaining a substantial amount of prize money following his successful leadership during the siege of Havana in 1762. It was altered and enlarged in 1766 by architect Robert (later Sir Robert) Taylor. Elliot owned the house until his death in 1790. It was renamed Heathfield Park after him in 1791 by his successor Francis Newbery, son of the publisher John Newbery. Newbery hired Humphrey Repton to landscape the park. Newbery built the ""Gibraltar Tower"" in one corner of the park, to commemorate Lord Heathfield's successful defence of Gibraltar from 1779 to 1782. The ground floor is octagonal and the upper part round, accessed by an internal circular staircase. It is also a Grade II* listed building. From 1819 to 1890, Heathfield Park was the seat of the baronets of the Blunt family. It was later owned by art patron William Cleverley Alexander, who had it remodelled in 1895 in the Georgian Revival style by architect Sir Reginald Blomfield. Brick facing was substituted for stucco, and the south-east wing was added. Alexander, who owned Aubrey House in London, died when he fell down the basement stairs of the house in 1916. Heathfield House is a Grade II* listed building. In 1963 the estate was purchased by Gerald Moore, an oral surgeon, artist, and former child actor. Moore opened the gardens to the public and established a riding school in 1963. In 1970 he restored the Gibraltar Tower, and in the 1970s he established a wildlife park. Moore sold the estate in 1993. The estate is currently privately owned. Site of Special Scientific Interest Part of the grounds is Heathfield Park SSSI, a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, due to the habitats provided by the ghyll woodland. The lichen population is important on a county level. Heathfield Park Cricket Club Part of the grounds of Heathfield Park contains a cricket club. Founded in 1878, it hosts regular league and friendly cricket for both adults and children.

"Lillias Margaret Skene, (née Hamilton; 28 March 186725 March 1957) was an Australian women's rights activist. Early life Lillias Hamilton was born on 28 March 1867 in Smythesdale, Victoria, Australia, the third child of Scottish-born police magistrate John Prendergast Hamilton and his English-vbrn wife Agnes Margaret (née Buchanan). Hamilton attended the local Alexandra College in Hamilton. On 7 November 1888 at St Mary's Anglican Church in Caulfield, she married 33-year-old sheepmaster David Alexander Skene. Career Straddled in debt, Hamilton's husband had to seek employment in New South Wales, while she and her children remained in Hamilton. In 1900 the family moved to Manly, Sydney, where they ran a modest dairy farm. In 1906, they moved to Melbourne and her husband began selling wool. The family purchased a property in South Yarra in 1910. Unable to make the second payment on the property he was buying when the banks collapsed in the early 1890s, David was forced to work as a station-manager in New South Wales. Lillias and their children stayed at Hamilton. They rejoined him at Curraweena station, near Bourke, in 1896 before moving to Glenariff and then in 1900 to Manly, Sydney. There they invested in a small dairy and leased 25 acres (10 ha). In the face of drought and the high cost of fodder, they sold out in 1906 and moved to Melbourne, where David set up as a woolbroker and stock-and-station agent. In 1910, with money inherited from her mother, Lillias acquired a house for the family at South Yarra. Skene was the assistant-secretary of the National Council of Women of Victoria (Victorian NCW). In 1915, she became the honorary manager and storekeeper of the Melbourne-based Home Hospital situated in the Government House. In 1909, she was appointed as the honorary secretary of the Women's Hospital Committee's board of management. Final years She retired from most of her commitments in 1949 and moved to Brighton. Skene died on 25 March 1957 in Armadale and was buried at the Brighton cemetery. Skene Street, in the Canberra suburb of Cook, is named in her honour.

"The Ghost-Seer or The Apparitionist (full title: Der Geisterseher – Aus den Papieren des Grafen von O**; literally, The Ghost-Seer – From the papers of the Count of O**) is a novel by Friedrich Schiller. It first appeared in several instalments from 1787 to 1789 in the journal Thalia, later appearing as a three-volume book in its own right. Content The work is narrated in the first person by the 'Graf von O**' (Count of O**). It describes the story of a German prince visiting Venice at carnival time. Right at the start of the work, the Count stresses that this story might sound incredible, but that he had witnessed it with his own eyes. Furthermore, he talks of his disinterest in deceiving the public as ""at the time these pages will tread into the world, I will not be and will neither win nor lose by the account given."" Structurally and stylistically it is not a single story, but tells of a Jesuit secret society trying to convert a Protestant German prince to Catholicism and bring him to the throne back home in order to bolster its own power base. Writing of the Prince's fate, Schiller shows him as the key to the conflict between passion and morality, passion and duty. The work's passages on religious and historical philosophy show Schiller's Enlightenment ideals, with his critique of religion and society to the fore, though a deeper exploration of Immanuel Kant was to follow later. Due to the novel's slow formation and the author's antipathy to it, it was not planned from start to finish and its style and structure is not uniform throughout, ranging from rhetorical prose, to theatrical prose, to dialogues reminiscent of Don Carlos, to the popular elements of Gothic fiction. Legacy Although the book remained unfinished, its audiences were the largest for any of Schiller's work during his lifetime. The readership was attracted by its elements typical of the Gothic novel, such as necromancy, spiritualism and conspiracies. It is thought that Johann Georg Schröpfer may have provided the inspiration for the novel. The first English translation appeared in 1800 under the title ""The Armenian"". In 1922, The Ghost-Seer was completed by horror novelist Hanns Heinz Ewers. This version was not well received by literary critics.

"Smack was a Brazilian post-punk band from São Paulo, formed in 1983 and characterized by its raw and experimental instrumentation heavily influenced by Gang of Four, Talking Heads, Os Mutantes and The Jam, among others. The band ended in 1986, but reunited in 2005. It ceased activities definitely in 2015 after vocalist Sérgio Pamplona's death. History Smack was founded in São Paulo in 1983, after a meeting between Sandra Coutinho (who was also a founding member of Cabine C and the all-female band Mercenárias), Sérgio ""Pamps"" Pamplona (a former member of Itamar Assumpção's band Isca de Polícia and one-time collaborator for short-lived rock band Kleiderman), Edgard Scandurra (of Ira!) and Thomas Pappon (who was also playing with Voluntários da Pátria at the time, and would later join Fellini). The band's debut album, Ao Vivo no Mosh, was released in 1985 via famous independent label Baratos Afins; the band recorded it live in the Estúdios Mosh (albeit with no audience), hence the album's name. Pamps originally intended to record a proper live album, but budget constraints did not allow him to do so. In order to focus more on his then-new band Ira!, Edgard Scandurra left Smack in 1986. Now a trio, the band recorded their second and last full-length album, Noite e Dia, in the same year. It was also released by Baratos Afins. Some time after the release of Noite e Dia, Smack disbanded, with Thomas quoting the reason as being ""Pamps' lack of interest on continuing the band"", as well as lack of promotion and some personal problems. 19 years later, Smack reunited, albeit without Thomas Pappon (since he moved to Europe in 1990), and performed in some venues around Brazil, with Pitchu Ferraz replacing him as drummer. Two of their songs, ""Fora Daqui"" and ""Mediocridade Afinal"", would be also included in the compilation The Sexual Life of the Savages, released by Soul Jazz Records. In 2008, they released the extended play 3, via carioca independent label Midsummer Madness. It was their first release in 22 years. The band ended again on November 5, 2015, after Pamps' death due to cirrhosis. He was 62 years old.

The group consisted of six teams: Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Estonia, Cyprus, and Gibraltar. The draw for the first round (group stage) was held as part of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Preliminary Draw on 25 July 2015, starting 18:00 MSK (UTC+3), at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, Russia. Gibraltar was added to the group after the draw, after becoming FIFA members together with Kosovo in May 2016, and UEFA decided not to put Kosovo in same group as Bosnia and Herzegovina for security reasons. The group winners, Belgium, qualified directly for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The group runners-up, Greece, advanced to the play-offs as one of the best 8 runners-up, where they lost to Croatia and thus failed to qualify for the first time since 2006. Russia was initially partnered with the five-team Group H, which enabled the 2018 World Cup hosts to play centralised friendlies against these countries on their ""spare"" match dates. These friendlies would not have counted in the qualifying group standings. However, after the group was later expanded to include Gibraltar, these friendly matches were cancelled.

"Channel stuffing is a business practice in which a company, or a sales force within a company, inflates its sales figures by forcing more products through a distribution channel than the channel is capable of selling. Also known as trade loading, this can be the result of a company attempting to inflate its sales figures. Alternatively, it can be a consequence of a poorly-managed sales force attempting to meet short-term objectives and quotas in a way that is detrimental to a company in the long term. Channel stuffing has a number of long-term consequences for a company. Firstly, distributors will often return any unsold goods to the company, incurring a carrying cost and also developing a backlog of product inventory. Wildly fluctuating demand, combined with the excess inventory, leads to costly overtime and factory shutdowns. Even mild channel stuffing can spiral out of control as the sales department works to make up for prior overselling. Discounts used to drive trade loading can greatly affect profits, and even help establish gray market channels, because salespeople no longer adequately qualify their prospects. Occasionally, distribution channels such as large retailers have been known to identify the practice of channel stuffing by their suppliers, and use the phenomenon to their advantage. That is done by holding back on orders until the end of a supplier's quota period. The supplier's sales force then panic, and sell a large amount of the product under more favorable terms than they would under ordinary circumstances. At the beginning of the next period, no new orders are placed, and, barring any action, the cycle is then repeated. That affects customers, creating gluts and shortages as buyers turn to competing products. Corporations have been known to engage in channel stuffing and hide the activity from their investors. In the United States, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has in some cases litigated against such corporations, and private class-action suits have been filed. Channel stuffing might also be part of a broader pattern of financial impropriety. References Ethically disputed business practices Marketing techniques",human,informative
"Norton is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster (part of South Yorkshire, England), on the border with North Yorkshire. The civil parish also includes the villages of Campsall and Sutton, and has a population of 4,381, increasing to 4,625 at the 2011 Census. The northern boundary of the parish is marked by the River Went, while the Great North Road forms the western boundary. History Little is known about Norton until it was recorded in the Domesday Survey of 1086 when it probably had a population of 100 who were solely concerned with agriculture. During the medieval period that followed, Robin Hood was associated with Barnsdale Forest to the west whilst the nearby village of Campsall grew in importance, gaining a chartered market and Norman church. However, Norton gets few mentions in any surviving records from this time. At a later date, Norton Priory was developed on the banks of the River Went but this never grew to be particularly significant and was subsequently demolished following the dissolution of the monasteries in 1588. In 1745, Mary Ramsden of Norton died and left 50 shillings to the poor of Norton and ‘several estates’ to the master and fellows of Catherine Hall, Cambridge. Thus a Cambridge College became the Lord of the Manor of Norton and a handsome manor house was built in the village. In the 1800s the Forrester's Arms and the School Boy Inn were both established to serve the local population which would still be devoted to agriculture. Following the industrial revolution and the expansion of the railways, a station was opened in Norton in 1855 on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway’s Knottingley Branch. At the start of the 20th century there were rumours of the development of collieries at nearby Kirk Smeaton and Askern. As Norton was located between the two, a number of rows of red brick terraces were erected speculatively to house the anticipated influx of miners. Subsequently, Askern Colliery was opened in 1910 and a new red brick pub, the Royal Hotel, was built in Norton to serve the colliers of the village. Throughout the 20th century small areas of housing have been built throughout the village and many of the original stone cottages with their long gardens have been demolished, and infilled with housing. The Manor House was pulled down in the 1970s and other older buildings have suffered the same fate since then, e.g. Hope Farm was demolished in 2002 to be replaced a small development of private housing. Village today In the 21st century Norton serves as a commuter village for people working in the nearby towns such as Doncaster and Pontefract. It retains two pubs, a Working Mens Club and one village shop, but the only structure left of historic importance is the Grade II listed village water pump.

"Ngewo ( in Mende) is the supreme creator god of the people of Mende from Sierra Leone. Representation Ngewo is a combined deity from the male god Ngewo and the female goddess Leve, who predated Ngewo as the supreme creator god honored by the Mende people. These two gods are now worshipped together under Ngewo, with Leve considered as his consort. Ngewo is a sky god, responsible for creating the universe, and is in charge of determining earth’s natural phenomena. He is popularly depicted as a distant deity, who does not concern himself with the day-to-day goings of his worshippers. However, in certain myths, Ngewo tends to punish those who forget to pray to him as well as those who do not pay tribute to him. He communicates with the Mende people through the help of their ancestors’ spirits, dyinyinga, who also demand certain food offerings. Legends Creation of the first human Ngewo originally lived alone on earth in a cave. One day, he wanted company, so he started creating animals, in a female-male pair. Eventually, he created the first man and the first woman. Ngewo gave his creations freedom to ask him of anything, which backfired after a while. He was overwhelmed with their requests and retreated to the heavens, where he had lived since then. Origin of death Ngewo gave two messages to be received by the Mende people and told two animals, the toad and the dog, to send these messages to earth. The dog was entrusted with telling humans that they will not die, while the toad would bring a message foretelling their death instead. Unfortunately, the toad arrived first, since the dog was distracted. Thus, death became humanity’s fate.

"The Tomb of Eve, also known as Eve's Grave and Eve's Tomb, is an archeological site located in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (). It is considered by some Muslims to be the burial place of Eve. Prince Faisal, Viceroy of Hejaz, destroyed it in 1928. In 1975, the site was also sealed with concrete by religious authorities, who disapprove of pilgrims praying at tombs. Richard Francis Burton mentions seeing it in his translation of the Book of a Thousand Nights and a Night. According to folk belief, Eve is considered the grandmother of humanity, which influenced the name Jeddah which means grandmother in Arabic. Mentions Angelo Pesce mentions the site in his book on Jeddah and the earliest documented reference to the tomb: British Acting Consul S. R. Jordan, writing in early 1926, describes the tomb as follows: Dimensions Émile-Félix Gautier estimates the length of the tomb to about 130 m.

"The Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother are a Catholic congregation of Franciscan religious sisters founded in Rome, Italy, in 1883, who serve worldwide, particularly in the field of healthcare. Foundations The congregation was founded at the initiative of Father Francis Mary of the Cross Jordan, founder of what was to become the Society of the Divine Savior, commonly known as the Salvatorians, as the female community of the Society. Jordan invited a young woman, Amalia Streitel (1844-1911), then a Carmelite nun in Germany, who had already been a Franciscan teaching Sister, to move to Rome to lead this effort. She left Germany for Italy, where she received the religious habit of the new Society and the religious name of Mother Frances of the Cross on 16 February 1883. She arrived to find that the housing Jordan had procured for her was an apartment lacking furniture and cooking utensils. As she was joined by other women, the Sisters took in orphans of the city, caring for them in their own apartment. Differences in vision arose between the two and in 1885, the Sisters separated from the Salvatorians. The 36 women who formed the community then went under the authority of the Diocese of Rome and were given the name by which they are now known. The congregation took the Rule of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis at that time, combining a life of service with that of contemplation. To support themselves, the Sisters provided home nursing care and worked in the sacristy of the Church of Santa Maria della Pietà in Camposanto dei Teutonici, the German national church of Rome. In 1890 Streitel arrived in the United States at the request of the Bishop of Wichita in Kansas, that the congregation take over a hospital there which was faltering. From there they expanded to Wisconsin, where they established a number of hospitals. A health resort was later opened in Denville, New Jersey, and a mission was opened in Oklahoma. Final approval of the congregation was received on 6 March 1911 by Pope Pius X, the same day that Streitel died in Castel Sant'Elia, Italy. Current status Today the Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother serve in Italy, Austria, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Germany, the United States, Grenada, St. Lucia, Tanzania and Trinidad and Tobago.

"Antony Thachuparambil (8 December 1894 – 9 June 1963), popularly known as the Missionary of Chelakkara was an Indian Syro-Malabar priest and social reformer who worked in the backward area of Chelakkara, Thrissur District, Kerala, India. He was declared Servant of God by the Holy See in 2009 for his Heroic Virtues. Early years Antony Thachuparambil was born on 8 December 1894 in Kottat, a suburban village of Chalakudy in Kerala to Poulose and Rosa. He had his early schooling in Chalakudy Government High School and college education in St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli. He continued his pastoral education at Mary Matha Major Seminary, Thrissur and was ordained on 22 Dec 1924. Social career Thachuparambil started his career in 1928 as the first Chaplain of Chelakkara, a backward forest area in Thrissur. There, he worked among the poor and he built St. Mary's Forane Church, a school for girls (Little Flower Girls High School), a destitute home for children which was later renamed Fr. Antony Balabhavan, a convent for nuns, Little Flower Convent and a health clinic which later grew to become Jeevodaya Mission Hospital. Canonization Thachuparambil is said to be credited with several miracles which are being considered and verified by Roman Catholic Church. His contributions for the overall development of Chelakkara, reportedly irrespective of the caste, creed or colour, were considered by the Roman Catholic Church when deciding upon initiation of his canonization process. Paul Pulikkan was appointed the postulator and as the first step towards canonization, Antony Thachuparambil was declared Servant of God by the Roman Catholic Church on 9 December 2009. In December 2020, the diocese court completed the formalities and prepared an 8090-page document detailing the priest's life and works, to be submitted to the Holy See. In the media Shalom Television aired a documentary on the life of Thachuparambil as an episode under their series, Saints Town in 2015.

"Aerodyne Technologies was a French aircraft manufacturer based in Étrembières and previously based in Talloires. The company specialized in the design and manufacture of paragliders and reserve parachutes. The company seems to have been founded before 2002 and gone out of business in 2008. The company was owned by Aerodyne International Group, which was headed by Dominique Marcu and seems to also no longer exist. Aerodyne Technologies was headed by Michel Le Blanc, who was formerly employed by paraglider manufacturers ITV Parapentes and Flying Planet. While headquartered in France, Aerodyne Technologies had its gliders constructed in a newly built factory in Mauritius. The company constructed a full line of gliders, from the beginner Aerodyne Yogi to the high-performance Shaman and the two-place Totem Bi for flight training. In 2003 the company's Jumbe glider was tested by South African reviewer Jaco Wolmarans in Annecy, France, against seven other competitor's gliders. He became very impressed with the stability and performance of the design in thermal flying and also with the company itself. He wrote, ""I was so impressed by the company, after chatting to them about their range, workmanship and the like, that I offered to represent them in SA. They agreed."" In early 2008, just before it went out of business, the company had certified its Joy model in four sizes as EN B. The Aerodyne Free had been released as a beginner's aerobatic model and the Feel was undergoing testing for certification in the EN C category, at that time forecast for April 2008.

Three years later, however, the magazine rated Macaroni Grill as the healthiest Italian chain, noting that a number of entrees had significantly decreased in calorie count.

"Red flag laws were laws in the United Kingdom and the United States enacted in the late 19th century, requiring drivers of early automobiles to take certain safety precautions, including waving a red flag in front of the vehicle as a warning. Red flag law in the United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the Locomotive Acts was a policy requiring self-propelled vehicles to be led by a pedestrian waving a red flag or carrying a lantern to warn bystanders of the vehicle's approach. In particular The Locomotive Act 1865, also known as Red Flag Act, stated: Firstly, at least three persons shall be employed to drive or conduct such locomotive, and if more than two waggons or carriages he attached thereto, an additional person shall be employed, who shall take charge of such waggons or carriages; Secondly, one of such persons, while any locomotive is in motion, shall precede such locomotive on foot by not less than sixty yards, and shall carry a red flag constantly displayed, and shall warn the riders and drivers of horses of the approach of such locomotives, and shall signal the driver thereof when it shall be necessary to stop, and shall assist horses, and carriages drawn by horses, passing the same, The Red Flag Law was repealed in 1896, by which time the internal combustion engine was well into its infancy. Red flag law in the United States In the United States, the state of Vermont passed a similar Red Flag Law in 1894, only to repeal it two years later. This law stated that ""he owner or person in charge of a carriage, vehicle or engine propelled by steam, except road rollers"" must have a ""person of mature age  at least one-eight of a mile in advance of"" the vehicle, to warn those with livestock of its impending arrival.

"""The Novocaine Mutiny"" is an episode from the TV series M*A*S*H, the twentieth episode of its fourth season. It was aired on January 27, 1976, was written by Burt Prelutsky and directed by Harry Morgan. As Prelutsky had written a number of episodes of Dragnet, of which Morgan had been a main cast member, the episode could be said to be a reunion, of sorts, between the two men. Synopsis October 1952 Frank Burns has filed charges of mutiny against Hawkeye Pierce for an incident that happened during a busy surgical shift in the operating room. A preliminary hearing is convened to determine whether Hawkeye should face a court-martial, which could lead to his execution if he is found guilty. B. J. Hunnicutt is called as the first witness and begins to recount the events that led to the alleged mutiny. As soon as Colonel Potter departed for Tokyo for a week, Frank assumed temporary command and immediately began to implement his gung-ho vision for the camp, including a ban on gambling. When he learned that Staff Sergeant Zale had lost $300, he instituted a camp-wide search for the money, ignoring repeated insistences that Zale had lost it in a poker game. Radar is called as the next witness and testifies to Frank's intrusive search methods, ending at Radar's own bunk in the camp office. Frank never found the money because Radar had hidden it in his teddy bear. The presiding officer, Lt. Colonel Carmichael, now calls Frank to describe the mutiny itself. Frank embellishes his account to cast himself in a heroic light - performing multiple difficult surgeries, bolstering everyone's spirits, and even taking over for an exhausted Father Mulcahy to administer last rites for a patient. He claims that an overworked Hawkeye drugged him into unconsciousness and took command of the unit. Hawkeye disputes the entire story, stating that Frank had been sending patients into the OR at risk of death during surgery, instead of doing the proper pre-op workup on them. Frank accused Hawkeye and B.J. of nitpicking and complained that the surgical staff would have no chance of keeping up with the influx of wounded. When Hawkeye half-jokingly threatened Frank with physical violence, Frank backed away and was hit in the face and knocked out by an opening door. Hawkeye sent Mulcahy to work in pre-op and had Corporal Klinger drag Frank out of the OR. Carmichael decides that the evidence does not warrant a court-martial and dismisses the proceedings, expressing his derisive opinion that Frank might have been made a pastry chef if he had not been drafted as a doctor. Afterward, back at camp, Hawkeye and B. J. start a new poker game and Potter joins in, ignoring Frank's un-rescinded order against gambling.

"Boneland is a 2012 novel by Alan Garner, a sequel to The Weirdstone of Brisingamen and The Moon of Gomrath. The boy Colin from the earlier novels is now an adult, still living near the top of Alderley Edge but now a professor working at the nearby Jodrell Bank Observatory. His solitary home is a kit-built hut (""A Bergli"") in a quarry. He has a form of amnesia which means he remembers nothing from before the age of 13, including his twin sister and his childhood adventures. He visits a psychotherapist and the gradual uncovering of his past forms the main story. Interleaved with Colin's tale is another story set in the same part of England but at a distant time. A lone Stone-Age cave dweller leaves ""Ludcruck"" (the chasm of Ludchurch) in search of companionship. Garner says that the focus of his research for the book was ""the universal myth of the sleeping hero"". He has written his own experience of psychotherapy into the novel. ""Go to the pain,"" he was told by his therapist, ""go to where it hurts the most, and say whatever it tells you"". An important item towards the end of the book is a Lower Palaeolithic hand axe. Garner keeps such an axe in his study, although his is from the Acheulean culture while the one in the book is from the even older Abbevillian culture.

"WENU (1410 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a soft oldies format simulcasting WROW out of Albany. Licensed to South Glens Falls, New York, United States, the station serves the Glens Falls area. Established in 1988 as WSTL, the station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting. History First usage of frequency in Glens Falls 1410 AM went on the air as WSET in 1959, programming a middle of the road format; for a time, the station studios were located in the Queensbury Hotel in Glens Falls. In 1965, WSET changed its call letters to WBZA; the new call letters arose from the station owner's respect for WBZ in Boston. WSET and WBZA broadcast at 1410 AM with a ""daytime only"" license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). At sunset each day, the station would leave the air until the next day at 6am. In 1971, the format was flipped to Top 40. During the later 1970s, WBZA evolved to more of an adult contemporary format, and it eventually changed frequencies to 1230, in late 1982; that station is now WMML, a sister station to WENU. Current station From 1982 to 1988, the 1410 frequency previously occupied by WBZA was off the air, until returning as country music station WSTL in 1988. The station took on the WBZA call letters in early January 1998, and changed again in September 2000 to the current WENU. For a time being, WENU was a simulcast of the FM station, now WNYQ, with an Adult Standards format. When the FM changed to AC, WENU remained with Adult Standards. More recently, WENU has flipped to a Classic Country format. On January 30, 2012, WENU, along with sister station WMML, signed off the air, as the antenna in Queensbury, New York was torn down to allow a new antenna to be put up in place. WENU returned to the air with a new nickname, ""The U"" on March 15, 2012 and a greater focus on community news coverage. WENU's new signal allows people in northern Warren County and southern Saratoga County to hear the station. WENU's Classic Country format came to an end on February 22, 2013 while CBS Sports Radio came on February 23, 2013.

"Euseby Cleaver (8 September 1745 – 10 December 1819) was the Church of Ireland Bishop of Ferns and Leighlin (1789–1809) in Ireland and subsequently Archbishop of Dublin (1809-1819). Life He was of Buckinghamshire origin, the younger son of the Reverend William Cleaver, who ran a school at Twyford, and his wife Martha Lettice Lushden. He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, graduating B.A. in 1767, M.A. in 1770, B.D. and D.D. in 1783. In 1774, he was presented to the rectory of Spofforth, North Yorkshire, which he held till 1783, when Lord Egremont, whose tutor he had been, presented him to the rectories of Tillington, West Sussex and Petworth. He was briefly Bishop of Cork and Ross, before in 1789 being translated to Ferns and Leighlin. During the 1798 insurrection in Ireland his palace in Ferns was ransacked and Cleaver was obliged to take refuge in Beaumaris, Anglesey which was in his brother, William Cleaver's diocese of Bangor, Gwynedd, where he lived at what is now the Bishopsgate Hotel. His exercise of the Archbishopric of Dublin was cut short for reasons of alleged insanity. He appears to have favoured the use of the Irish language. Family He married Catherine Wynne of Hazelwood, County Sligo, by whom he had several children, including William, Frances and Caroline; Caroline married Admiral James William King, and was the mother of the prominent evangelist Catherine Pennefather. The Archbishop's wife died on 1 May 1816. His brother William Cleaver was successively bishop of Chester and (1800) bishop of Bangor.

"Araucaria rulei (Rule araucaria, graceful pine) is a species of conifer in the family Araucariaceae. It is endemic to New Caledonia, where it is an endangered species. Its populations are fragmented and are generally made up of scattered individuals. It is restricted to serpentine soils, often with high nickel levels, and its natural range is almost completely restricted to areas rich in nickel. Nickel mining in New Caledonia has consequently been a major cause of its decline. Araucaria rulei grows to around 30 meters in height, with long slender branches arranged symmetrically around the trunk, which extend horizontally and then turn upwards and branch out at the end, giving the tree an appearance sometimes compared to a chandelier. Male and female cones are produced on the same tree but on different branches, with branches at the top of the tree tending to produce female cones, while branches lower down make male cones. The cones stay on the tree for 2–3 years while the seeds ripen, which are around 3 cm long when mature. It is a slow-growing plant with slow regeneration capabilities, though in its natural environment it is tolerant of both very dry conditions and high winds which many other species of araucaria will not tolerate. The species was named for an Australian nurseryman John Rule, and is sometimes grown as an ornamental tree in Australia, with its large smooth leaves and the symmetrical dome shaped growth habit of mature trees considered attractive.

The Assembly converted into a legislative parliament after the constitution was promulgated in 2015. The legislature parliament's term ended on 14 October 2017. Opening Former Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, the oldest member of the house, assumed chairmanship of the CA on January 20, 2014 and administered the oath of office to 565 lawmakers at the first meeting of the assembly on January 21, 2014. Leaders of the NC, CPN-UML and UCPN (Maoist) pledged to draft a new constitution within a year. More than 80% of the members were new faces. Power-sharing discussions On January 26, 2014, President Ram Baran Yadav called for the election of a Prime Minister and the formation of a consensus government within a week as per article 38(1) of the constitution which provided for the formation of government through political understanding. The Nepali Congress obtained the support of the CPN-UML for a NC-led consensus government and the two parties also agreed to hold local body elections within six months and adopt a new constitution within a year. An all-party meeting followed at which the CPN-UML, UCPN (Maoist) and MPRF-Loktantrik expressed support for a government under Sushil Koirala. The RPP-N boycotted the meeting. Further discussions were held between the NC, CPN-UML and UCPN (Maoist) at which the Maoists expressed support for the idea of a NC-led government but did not agree to join the government and decided to stay in opposition. On February 2, 2014, the NC abandoned its pursuit of a consensus government under article 38(1) of the constitution after the UCPN (Maoist) and RPP-N, the third and fourth largest parties, decided not to join the government. The party then initiated talks with the CPN-UML to form a majority government under article 38(2) of the constitution.

She made 10 knots. Career The ship would have plied the service between Bristol and North America which the Bristol City Line started in 1879 and continued until the 1970s. During the Second World War she was damaged by a bomb in December 1940 while in the Albion Dockyard. After repairs, the ship was part of convoys of merchant ships across the Atlantic.

" Despite a short-lived increase in Palestinian jobs in 2003, the economy is performing well below its potential, said a World Bank report.  Unemployment stood at 25%, compared with 10% before the uprising against Israeli occupation four years ago. Young people are particularly hard hit with 37% out of work, compared with 14% four years ago. But 104,000 new jobs were created last year during a brief easing of violence and closures. However, during the first half of this year, the Palestinian economy lost more than 22,000 jobs. Last year's growth rate of 6% can also be attributed to this temporary gap in violence, the report said. According to the report, Intifada, Closures and Palestinian Economic Crisis: An Assessment, there is a close link between the number of closures - both border closures and internal closures between cities - and Palestinian economic problems. The closures arranged by Israel restrict the movement of Palestinian people and goods, slowing down trade.  ""Closures are a key factor behind today's economic crisis in the West Bank,"" said Nigel Roberts, World Bank country director for the West Bank and Gaza. Nearly half of all Palestinians - some 47% - live below the poverty line and are particularly vulnerable to economic shocks. The report said even more would be on the poverty line without an average of $950m a year from international donors, some of which goes towards job creation. It also called on the Palestinian Authority to revive its reform programme and maintain financial discipline to create an investment-friendly climate. This week Colin Powell, US Secretary of State was visiting the West Bank to stress US support for a smooth Palestinian election in January. ",human,news

" A close associate of former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky has told a court that fraud charges levelled against him are ""false"".  Platon Lebedev has been on trial alongside Mr Khodorkovsky since June in a case centring around the privatisation of a fertiliser firm. The pair claim they are being punished by the authorities for the political ambitions of Mr Khodorkovsky. Mr Lebedev said there were ""absurd contradictions"" in the case. Opening his defence, he said he could not see the legal basis of the charges he faced, which also include allegations of tax evasion. ""To my embarrassment, I could not understand the file of complaints against me,"" he told a Moscow court. Mr Lebedev headed the Menatep group, the parent company of Yukos.  Mr Lebedev and Mr Khodorkovsky, who each face a possible 10 year jail sentence if convicted, will be questioned by a judge over the next few days. Mr Khodorkovsky began his testimony last week, telling the court that he objected to the way that the ""running of a normal business has been presented as a work of criminal fiction"". The charges are seen by supporters as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the country's super-rich business leaders, the so-called oligarchs. Yukos has been presented with a $27.5bn (£13bn) tax demand by the Russian authorities and its key Yugansk division was auctioned off to part settle the bill. The company's effort to gain bankruptcy protection in the US - in a bid to win damages for the sale - were dismissed by a court in Texas. ",human,news

" Actress Nicole Kidman has won a restraining order against two paparazzi photographers who she claims left her fearful of leaving her Sydney mansion.  The Oscar-winning star took action against Jamie Fawcett and Ben McDonald after a bugging device was found outside her home earlier this week. Lawyers for the pair denied allegations they had planted the device. The Australian actress is currently in Sydney to film her latest movie, Eucalyptus, with Russell Crowe. Kidman was prompted to take action following a reported high-speed car chase with members of the paparazzi in Sydney last weekend.  According to local newspaper the Daily Telegraph, the incident involved paparazzi driving through red lights and on the wrong side of the road in pursuit of Kidman's vehicle. Lawyers for Mr Fawcett and Mr McDonald denied that the pair were involved in the chase. Kidman sought the ""apprehended violence"" orders - normally used in Australia in cases of domestic violence and similar incidents - after being advised to do so by local police. ""Nicole would like to make it clear that she acknowledges she is a public figure and that reporters and photographers have a job to do and she respects that,"" said Kidman's publicist Wendy Day. ""However, these are specific actions against two individuals who, over a period of time, have caused her to feel threatened, intimidated and unable to leave her home without fearing for her safety."" Magistrate Lee Gilmore, who issued the restraining order at Waverley Local Court in Sydney, said she understood the photographers were entitled to earn a living but there had to be limits to their behaviour. ""Miss Kidman says she's willing to put up with some of it, but it's gone beyond that,"" she said. ""I do believe the allegation in relation to the driving is a serious issue."" ",human,news

" The sixth and final Star Wars movie may not be suitable for young children, film-maker George Lucas has said.  He told US TV show 60 Minutes that Revenge of the Sith would be the darkest and most violent of the series. ""I don't think I would take a five or six-year-old to this,"" he told the CBS programme, to be aired on Sunday. Lucas predicted the film would get a US rating advising parents some scenes may be unsuitable for under-13s. It opens in the UK and US on 19 May. He said he expected the film would be classified PG-13 - roughly equivalent to a British 12A rating.  The five previous Star Wars films have all carried less restrictive PG - parental guidance - ratings in the US. In the UK, they have all been passed U - suitable for all - with the exception of Attack of The Clones, which got a PG rating in 2002.

" Telecoms equipment maker Nortel Networks has sharply revised downwards its profits for the 2003 fiscal year.  In a long-awaited filing, Nortel said it had made $434m (£231m), compared to the previously reported $732m. But the figures - revised after an audit which led to the sacking of the Canadian firm's chief - showed revenue was about 4% higher than first thought. Nortel shares, which have lost nearly 50% of their value since last year, climbed 1.46% in Toronto on Tuesday. Nortel's head Frank Dunn and two other executives were fired in January last year after the company announced it had conducted the internal audit.

" Tony Blair is likely to name 5 May as election day when Parliament returns from its Easter break, the BBC's political editor has learned.  Andrew Marr says Mr Blair will ask the Queen on 4 or 5 April to dissolve Parliament at the end of that week. Mr Blair has so far resisted calls for him to name the day but all parties have stepped up campaigning recently. Downing Street would not be drawn on the claim, saying election timing was a matter for the prime minister.  A Number 10 spokeswoman would only say: ""He will announce an election when he wants to announce an election."" The move will signal a frantic week at Westminster as the government is likely to try to get key legislation through Parliament. The government needs its finance bill, covering the Budget plans, to be passed before the Commons closes for business at the end of the session on 7 April.  But it will also seek to push through its Serious and Organised Crime Bill and ID cards Bill. Mr Marr said on Wednesday's Today programme: ""There's almost nobody at a senior level inside the government or in Parliament itself who doesn't expect the election to be called on 4 or 5 April. ""As soon as the Commons is back after the short Easter recess, Tony Blair whips up to the Palace, asks the Queen to dissolve Parliament ... and we're going.""

" The UK pension system has been branded inadequate and too complex by a leading retirement think-tank.  The Pensions Policy Institute (PPI) said replacing the state pension with a ""citizen's pension"" would help tackle inequality and complexity. The change would see pensions being calculated on length of residency in the UK rather than National Insurance (NI) contributions. Reform could reduce poverty by aiding people with broken employment records.  The PPI added that once the state system was reformed the government should look at options to overhaul private and workplace pensions. The think tank's proposals were made in response to the recent publication of the Pensions Commission's initial report into UK retirement savings. According to the Pensions Commission's report 12 million working people are not saving enough for their retirement. As a result, living standards could fall for the next generation of UK pensioners. The report added that a combination of higher taxes, higher savings and/or a higher average retirement age was needed to solve the UK pension crisis. ",human,news
" Australian airline Qantas has posted a record fiscal first-half profit thanks to cost-cutting measures.  Net profit in the six months ending 31 December rose 28% to A$458.4m ($357.6m; £191m) from a year earlier. Analysts expected a figure closer to A$431m. Qantas shares fell almost 3%, however, after it warned that earnings growth would slow in the second half. Sales will dip by at least A$30m after the Indian ocean tsunami devastated many holiday destinations, Qantas said.  ""The tsunami affected travel patterns in ways that we were a bit surprised about,"" chief executive Geoff Dixon explained. ""It certainly affected Japanese travel into Australia. As soon as the tsunami hit we saw ... a lessening with bookings for Australia."" Higher fuel costs also are expected to eat into earnings in coming months. ""We don't have as much hedging benefit in the second half as we had in the first,"" said chief financial officer Peter Gregg. Qantas is facing increased pressure from rivals such as low-cost carrier Virgin Blue and the Australian government is in talks about whether to allow Singapore Airlines to fly between the Australia and the US - one of Qantas' key routes.  Even so, the firm is predicting that full-year earnings will increase from the previous 12 months. Analysts have forecast full-year profit will rise about 11% to around A$720 million ($563 million). Qantas boss Mr Dixon also said he would be reviewing the group's cost-cutting measures. During the first six months of the fiscal year, Qantas made savings of A$245m, and is on track to top its target of A$500m for the full year. Last month, the company warned it may transfer as many as 7,000 jobs out Australia, with Mr Dixon quoted as saying that the carrier could no longer afford to remain ""all-Australian"". ",human,news
" Sir Anthony Meyer, the Tory backbencher who challenged Margaret Thatcher for the party leadership in 1989, has died.  He was 84, had been suffering from cancer for many months, and died at his London home. That failed ""stalking horse"" leadership challenge made it easier for Michael Heseltine to mount his own bid. That in turn paved the way for John Major to move into 10 Downing Street, after the second ballot. Meyer's constituency party, Clwyd North West, which he had represented as an MP for more than 20 years, deselected him as a result of that challenge. Sir Anthony John Charles Meyer was born on 27 October, 1920. Educated at Eton, and at New College, Oxford, he served in the Scots Guards from 1941 to 1945 and was wounded in tanks in Normandy. He worked under Edward Heath on Europe at the Foreign Office and subsequently won the Eton and Slough seat for the Tories in 1964 - by 11 votes. Labour regained the seat two years later, and Meyer had to wait until 1970 before he could re-enter Parliament. His prospects of a front bench slot remained remote because he tended to defy the party line. ",human,news

Club director Terry Brady held initial talks with Strachan on Saturday. The former Scotland international added that joining Southampton's local rivals would not be a wise move. ""It's got everything going for it but I've got too many memories of the other side and I don't want to sour those memories,"" he said.

" UK interest rates are set to remain on hold at 4.75% following the latest meeting of the Bank of England.  The Bank's rate-setting committee has put up rates five times in the past year but rates have been on hold since September amid signs of a slowdown. Economic growth slowed in the previous quarter, as manufacturing output fell, while consumer confidence has slipped. There is also growing evidence that the previously booming UK housing market is now cooling.  House prices fell 0.4% in October, according to the Nationwide, their biggest monthly fall since February 2001. Last month, Bank of England governor Mervyn King said that the economy had hit a ""softer patch"" after rapid economic growth in the first half of 2004. Richard Jeffrey, chief economist at Bridgewell Securities, said it was very unlikely that the Bank of England would put rates up again this time around. ""There have been sufficient signs in the economy of a slowdown to stay the Bank of England's hand,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

But his lawyer said the money could not be raised on time. Mr Doherty, 25, was arrested following an alleged incident in a London hotel on Wednesday evening. Musician Alan Wass, 23, also of north London, appeared in court accused of the same offences.  Magistrates imposed a range of bail conditions on Mr Doherty including a curfew between 2200 and 0700, except when he attends a drug rehabilitation centre. He was told he would not be able to leave his home without being accompanied by a security firm. He must also surrender his passport and report daily to a local police station. Mr Wass was also given a curfew and told to surrender his passport. Mr Doherty left The Libertines at the end of June 2004, but continued performing with his band Babyshambles. The singer, who has been linked to supermodel Kate Moss, was arrested after police were called to the Islington hotel in response to claims that a man had been assaulted. A man in his 30s was later taken to University College Hospital, London, with facial injuries, before being discharged. A lawyer representing Mr Doherty and Mr Wass said outside court the pair strenuously denied the charges. ",human,news
" Former Olympic champion Michael Johnson has accused Britain's top sprinters of lacking pride and ambition.  ""At the moment, the biggest factor on the mind of British sprinters is to be number one in Britain,"" the world 200m and 400m record holder told Five Live. ""Athletics at the moment is all about international competitions and they need to show a little more pride."" However, Linford Christie countered: ""It's easy to criticise when you haven't gone through the system here."" Johnson was involved in a verbal spat with Britain's Darren Campbell earlier this year. The American had cast doubt on Campbell's claims he had torn a hamstring in the wake of his failure to reach the Olympic 100m and 200m finals.  And the American remains highly critical of aspects of British sprinting. ""The only time you see British sprinters getting upset or riled is when there is a debate as to which one is better than the other,"" he claimed. ""Athletes here have to compete more outside the UK. Their focus has to be on being the best in the world and not just on being the top British sprinter."" Speaking at an elite coaches' conference in Birmingham, Johnson also argued that although there has been more investment in the sport in Britain, it had not necessarily reaped the rewards. ""You can't fix everything with money,"" he admitted. ""You contrast the situation here to that of some US athletes who have no funding. ""Those who aren't funded might be hungrier and more motivated because their road to success is a lot more difficult and challenging. ""So when they get to the top they are more appreciative.""

" The January sales have failed to help the UK High Street recover from a poor Christmas season, a survey has found.  Stores received a boost from bargain hunters but trading then reverted to December levels, the British Retail Consortium and accountants KPMG said. Sales in what is traditionally a strong month rose by 0.5% on a like-for-like basis, compared with a year earlier. Consumers remain cautious over buying big-ticket items like furniture, said BRC director general Kevin Hawkins. Higher interest rates and uncertainty over the housing market continue to take their toll on the retail sector, the BRC said. But clothing and footwear sales were said to be generally better than December, while department stores also had a good month.  In the three-months to January, like-for-like sales showed a growth rate of -0.1%, the same as in the three months to December, the BRC said. ""Following a relatively strong New Year's bank holiday, trading then took a downward turn,"" said Mr Hawkins. ""Even extending some promotions and discounts and the pay-day boost later in the month could not tempt customers."" The previous BRC survey found Christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years for retailers. And according to Office for National Statistics data, sales in December failed to meet expectations and by some counts were the worst since 1981. ",human,news
" Telecoms equipment supplier Ericsson has posted a rise in fourth quarter profits thanks to clients like Deutsche Telekom upgrade their networks.  Operating profit in the three months to 31 December was 9.5bn kronor (£722m; $1.3bn) against 6.3bn kronor last year. Shares tumbled, however, as the company reported a profit margin of 45.6%, less than the 47.3% forecast by analysts and down from 47.1% in the third quarter. Ericsson shares dropped 5.9% to 20.7 kronor in early trading on Thursday. However, the company remained optimistic about its earnings outlook after sales in the fourth quarter rose 9% to 39.4bn kronor. ""Long-term growth drivers of the industry remain solid,"" Ericsson said in a statement.  Chief executive Carl-Henric Svanberg explained that about ""27% of the world's population now has access to mobile communications"". ""This is exciting for a company with a vision of an all-communicating world,"" he added. Mr Svanberg, however, warned that the extra demand that had driven 2004 sales had already dissipated and it was ""business as usual"". He added that sales in the first three months of 2005 would be subject to ""normal seasonality"". For the whole of 2004, Ericsson returned a net profit of 19bn kronor, compared with a loss of 10.8bn kronor in 2003. Sales climbed to 131.9 billion kronor from 117.7bn kronor in 2003. ",human,news
" Rapper Eminem has denied Elvis his fourth number one of the year, after his song, Like Toy Soldiers, stormed to the top of the singles charts.  The track claimed the top spot ahead of The King's latest re-release, Are You Lonesome Tonight. It is the fifth in a series of 18 reissues to mark the 70th anniversary of Presley's birth. Almost Here, the duet from former Westlife star Brian McFadden and Delta Goodrem, went in at number three.  Like Toy Soldiers, from Eminem's Encore album, is sampled from Martika's 1980s hit Toy Soldiers. It takes a swipe at hip-hop feuds and follows the success of Just Lose It. Last week's number one, Elvis's It's Now or Never, slipped 13 places to number 14, but all five of his re-released songs are in the Top 40. One World Project Tsunami fundraiser, Grief Never Grows Old, slipped four places to number eight. Featuring Cliff Richard and Boy George, the song was written by former DJ Mike Read. In the album charts, Athlete's latest offering Tourist claimed the top spot, toppling the Chemical Brother's Push The Button Down, which fell to number six. ",human,news
" Late R&B star Aaliyah's record company has failed in an attempt to sue the video producer who booked the ill-fated flight on which she died in 2001.  A New York appeals court has told Blackground Records that only the singer's parents had the right to launch a claim for wrongful death. The 22-year-old singer's family came to an undisclosed settlement over a negligence claim in 2003. Aaliyah had completed a music video when the plane crashed in the Bahamas. She and eight others were killed on the plane, which crashed as if left for Florida. Blackground Records' lawyer Frank Penski said he had yet to examine the decision and did not know whether they would pursue the case.  An investigation into the crash revealed the twin-engined Cessna was overloaded by 700 pounds (320kg). A post-mortem carried out on the remains of the pilot showed there was cocaine and alcohol in his body. Aaliyah was a rising star in music and film before she was killed. She was honoured with a string of posthumous awards and her single More Than A Woman went to number one in the UK. ",human,news
" Two of the largest airlines in the US - American and Southwest - have blamed record fuel prices for their disappointing quarterly results.  American Airlines' parent AMR reported a loss of $387m (£206m) for the fourth quarter of 2004, against a $111m loss for the same period a year earlier. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines saw its fourth-quarter 2004 profits fall 15% to $56m, against $66m a year earlier. Both said high fuel bills would continue to pressure revenues in 2005. American, the world's biggest airline by some measures, said it expected to report a loss for the first quarter of 2005. Southwest, which has the highest market value of any US carrier, said it would remain profitable despite high fuel prices.  AMR's shares were flat in Wednesday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as the results were slightly better than analysts had anticipated. AMR's chief executive Gerard Arpey said the airline's difficulties reflected the situation within the industry. ""AMR's results for the fourth quarter of 2004 reflect the economic woes that plagued the airline industry throughout 2004 - in particular, high fuel prices and a tough revenue environment,"" he said. For the full year, AMR posted a loss of $761m, lower than 2003's $1.2bn loss and an indication that the airline has successfully cut costs. AMR added that as part of its cost cutting measures, it is postponing the delivery of 54 Boeing jets. Shares in Southwest fell 65 cents to $14.35 as analysts voiced their disappointment. ""The results came in below our already conservative estimate for the quarter,"" said Ray Neidl, an analyst at Calyon Securities. Both American and Southwest have been squeezed by cut-throat competition in the US airline industry, as a glut of available seats has led to fierce price reductions. ",human,news
" Rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight has been arrested for violating his parole after he was allegedly found with marijuana.  He was arrested in Barstow, California, on Saturday following an alleged traffic offence. He is expected to be transferred to a state prison while a decision is made on whether he should be released. Mr Knight, founder of Death Row Records, served a 10-month jail term in 2004 for punching a man while on parole for an assault conviction. Police said Mr Knight was stopped on Saturday after performing an illegal U-turn and a search of his car allegedly found marijuana.  He is also accused of not having insurance. A 18-year-old woman in the car was arrested for providing false information and having a fake ID card. She was later released. It was his second alleged violation, having previously served half of a nine-year sentence for breaking the terms of his parole. Mr Knight, 39, was jailed in October 1996 following his involvement in a fight with a rival gang just hours before rapper Tupac Shakur was killed in a Las Vegas drive-by shooting. He was driving Shakur's car at the time and was shot in the head. At the time he was on probation for assaulting two musicians. Mr Knight, a former bodyguard, set up Death Row records in the early 1990s with Shakur and Dr Dre among his protegees. But the label has always been dogged by allegations it supports gang culture and fuels the east and west coast rap rivalry. ",human,news
" Shares in UK Coal have fallen after the mining group reported losses had deepened to £51.6m in 2004 from £1.2m.  The UK's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial action and ""operating flaws"" at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on Thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was making ""significant progress"" in shaking up the business. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The company said these actions should ""significantly uplift earnings"". It expected 2005 to be a ""transitional year"" and to return to profitability in 2006.  The recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule. ""We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues. We continue to make progress and great strides have already been made,"" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham. ",human,news
" South Korea's Hyundai Motor has announced that it plans to build a second plant in India to meet the country's growing demand for cars.  The company didn't give details of its investment but it said the new plant would produce 150,000 cars a year. This will boost the annual production capacity of the company - India's second-largest car manufacturer - to 400,000 units. Hyundai expects its sales in India to grow 16% to 250,000 in 2005. By 2010, it expects to nearly double sales to 400,000 cars. The new plant will be built close to the existing one in Chennai, in the southern province of Tamil Nadu.  South Korea's top car maker estimates that the Indian market will grow 15% this year, to 920,000 vehicles, reaching 1.6 million vehicles by 2010. Demand in India has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said. Figures show that currently only eight people per thousand are car owners. ""We desperately need to expand our production in order to meet growing demand in the Indian auto market, which is growing over 12 percent every year, and to top our competitors,"" chairman Chung Mong-koo said in the statement. He said the company plans to use India as a base for exports to Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. The company - which controls half of the South Korean's market - aims to become a global top five auto maker by 2010. ",human,news
" A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada.  The drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug's benefits. But now Canadian authorities have said the Sativex drug will be considered for approval.  Approximately 50,000 people in Canada have been diagnosed with MS and 85,000 people are suffering from the condition in the UK. Many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms.  Now, GW Pharma's Sativex mouth spray could be legally available to MS sufferers in Canada within the next few months. This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS. Final approval in Canada should now be little more than a formality, analysts said, and the company expects full approval for Sativex early in 2005. ""We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005,"" said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy.  The UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. Satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. Thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the English countryside. Despite hopes of regulatory approval last year, a series of delays has put back Sativex's launch in the UK. The latest news sent shares in GW Pharma up 8.5p, or 8.1%, to 113.5p. ",human,news
" Bath prop Duncan Bell has been added to England's 30-man squad to face Ireland in the RBS Six Nations.  And with Phil Vickery sidelined for at least six weeks with a broken arm and Julian White out with a neck injury, Bell could make his England debut. Bell, 30, had set his sights on an international career with Wales. But last December, the International Rugby Board confirmed that he could only be eligible for England as he had travelled on tour with them in 1998. England coach Andy Robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan into his front row. But Sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped Bell - who was among the tryscorers when England A beat France A 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in. Robinson also has an injury worry over centre Olly Barkley, who withdrew from Bath's starting line-up to face Gloucester last weekend.  He was due to have a hospital scan on Monday, while Gloucester centre Henry Paul, who started at fly-half against Bath, limped out at Kingsholm because of an ankle problem. Despite Barkley's three missed penalties in the 18-17 defeat against France, he is expected to retain his place at inside centre, although Leicester's in-form prospect Ollie Smith would be an obvious replacement. Bath coach John Connolly rates Barkley as no better than a 50/50 chance to make the Dublin trip. Uncapped fly-half Andy Goode has been named in a 30-man training squad for the Ireland game, and he strengthened his selection claims by kicking 28 points during Leicester's record 83-10 win against Newcastle on Sunday. England's players are due to meet at their Surrey training base on Monday. ",human,news
" Japanese communications firm Softbank has widened losses after heavy spending on a new cut-rate phone service.  The service, launched in December and dubbed ""Otoku"" or ""bargain"", has had almost 900,000 orders, Softbank said. The firm, a market leader in high-speed internet, had an operating loss for the three months to December of 7.5bn yen ($71.5m; £38.4m). But without the Otoku marketing spend it would have made a profit - and expects to move into the black in 2006. The firm did not give a figure for the extent of profits it expected to make next year. It was born in the 1990s tech boom, investing widely and becoming a fast-rising star, till the end of the tech bubble hit it hard. Its recent return to a high profile came with the purchase of Japan Telecom, the country's third-biggest fixed-line telecoms firm. The acquisition spurred its broadband internet division to pole position in the Japanese market, with more than 5.1 million subscribers at the end of December. ",human,news

Edwards then left in a surprise eviction, with 12% of the vote. Nineteen-year-old Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie is currently favourite to win the £50,000 charity prize.

" Japanese brewers are increasingly making money from beer-flavoured drinks rather than beer itself  Beer and spirits are heavily taxed in Japan, driving breweries to search for alternatives. Japan's long economic downturn helped drive the trend, as drinkers looked for cheaper opportunities to drown their sorrows. Now, according to Asahi Breweries, the market for so-called ""beer-like"" drinks is set to grow 84% this year.  Asahi is predicting profits to rise 50% in 2005 as it launches a drink based on soybean peptides rather than malt. The chosen name, ""Shinnama"" or ""new draft"", disguises its non-beer nature. But despite a record profit in 2004 of 30.6bn yen ($291m; £154m), up 31.8% on the previous year, Asahi is coming late to the market. Key rival Sapporo is already well-established with the beer-flavoured ""Draft One"". Suntory, meanwhile, is doing well with ""Super Blue"", which combines happoshu - an existing low-cost beer alternative made with malt and seawater - and shochu, a distilled alcohol derived from sweet potatoes or barley. Happoshu has been a mainstay of brewery profits for years, taking over from beer thanks to its low tax and therefore low cost. Kirin, the fourth big name, is launching its own ""third-type"" drink in April. ",human,news
" The inclusion of downloaded music in the official singles chart has been delayed for a month.  The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) had planned to include download formats in the chart from 20 March. But the date has been put back to 17 April to create a ""level playing field"" for independent labels. The BPI is concerned that independent repertoire is not adequately represented online and said they were looking at ways of rectifying it.  BPI chairman Peter Jamieson said: ""The inclusion of download formats in the Official UK Singles Chart is the most significant development in the charts for 20 years.  ""But for a multitude of reasons the current chart representation of independent repertoire at the major download outlets is poor.

" Motley Crue guitarist Mick Mars is being sued by his ex-girlfriend for $10 million (£5.4 million), claiming he broke a promise to take care of her.  The woman, Robin Mantooth, said Mars promised her repeatedly that he would provide financial support in the event of the couple breaking up. When they split in December, Mantooth says Mars denied any such agreement. She is asking a Los Angeles court to award her half the musician's property, a monthly allowance and damages. Mantooth added that the pair became lovers in 1990, after which she abandoned her career as a documentary film-maker to move in with the guitarist at his Malibu home.  She is also claiming that Mars, 53, has failed to provide her with any material support since they ceased to be a couple. Motley Crue recently reunited after being apart for a period of five years. They originally formed in the early 1980s and scored six hits in the UK, including Girls Girls Girls in 1987. They are embarking on a world tour later this year which will take in 60 cities across the US, Europe, Asia and Australia. Mars - real name Bob Allen Deal - underwent hip replacement surgery in October. He suffers from a degenerative rheumatic disease which causes ligaments and tendons to attach to the bone. ",human,news

" The owner of the technology-dominated Nasdaq stock index plans to sell shares to the public and list itself on the market it operates.  According to a registration document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Nasdaq Stock Market plans to raise $100m (£52m) from the sale. Some observers see this as another step closer to a full public listing. However Nasdaq, an icon of the 1990s technology boom, recently poured cold water on those suggestions.  The company first sold shares in private placements during 2000 and 2001. It technically went public in 2002 when the stock started trading on the OTC Bulletin Board, which lists equities that trade only occasionally.

" Actor Bruce Willis is suing Revolution Studios over an injury he said he suffered while making Tears of the Sun.  Willis is seeking medical expenses after he said he was hit in the head by a firework during the filming of the 2002 movie, produced by the firm. The lawsuit said the star has endured mental and physical injuries as a result of the alleged incident. ""We are not able to comment on pending litigation,"" Revolution Studios spokesman Sean Dudas said.  In Tears of the Sun Willis plays a US military commander who disobeys orders to try and help save a doctor and patients trapped in the Nigerian jungle. Directed by Antoine Fuqua, the film was poorly received by critics and did not perform strongly at the box office. According to the lawsuit, the injury was suffered during the firing of explosions as part of a special effect. The explosions, known as squibs, were intended to ""simulate the appearance of bullets striking the ground"". The lawsuit said Willis has endured ""extreme mental, physical and emotional pain and suffering."" There were no specific details on the injuries.

" Greek sprinter Kostas Kenteris has denied claims that he faked a motorbike crash to avoid a doping test days before the start of the Olympics.  Kenteris and fellow sprinter Katerina Thanou are set to learn if they will face criminal charges this week. Part of the investigation has centred on whether they staged the crash. Kenteris insisted: ""The accident happened. I went crazy when I found out I had supposedly missed a test and I wanted to rush to the Olympic village."" Kenteris, speaking on Greece's Alter Television station, also claimed that he asked to be tested for banned substances in hospital after the crash. ""I told the hospital, which was an Olympics-accredited hospital, to call the IOC and have me tested on the spot but no-one came.""  After a drama which dominated newspaper headlines in Greece as Athens prepared for the start of the Athens Games, Kenteris and Thanou eventually withdrew.

The cards will include a photograph of the ticket-holder plus an electronic chip with their details to prevent tickets being sold on or forged. Tickets for the June event are expected to go on sale in April. ""There is only one place in the world where you will be able to get tickets,"" festival organiser Michael Eavis said. ""That will be the official source. If you get them anywhere else, you won't get in."" Fans not wanting to carry the entrance card could present their passport or driving licence instead, he added.  More than 153,000 people are expected to travel to Mr Eavis' Somerset farm from 24-26 June, but the event's rising popularity has meant an extremely high demand for tickets in recent years. When the ID card idea was floated, Mr Eavis' daughter Emily said it would be ""quite a big step in terms of ticketing for events"" if implemented and they were ""going as far as we can"" to cut touting.

" The government has denied reports that Gordon Brown is preparing to oust Alan Milburn as Labour's election supremo.  Work and pensions minister Alan Johnson said it was wrong to suggest the chancellor would usurp Mr Milburn, adding they would ""work as a team"". A report in the Sunday Business claimed Mr Brown has been asked to take charge of media strategy, while Mr Milburn would move to a behind-the-scenes role. Labour has always maintained Mr Brown would have a central campaign role.  But many Labour backbenchers are said to be dissatisfied with the way election campaigning has gone and have said they wanted to see the chancellor take a bigger role. Some commentators say the Tories have grasped the initiative, putting Labour on the back foot, having to respond to Conservative policy announcements. These claims follow various opinion polls which suggest the Tories have been gaining on Labour. Party strategists are believed to want to bring Mr Brown to centre-stage having seen support rise, in private polling, after his Budget last week. But another report in the Sunday Telegraph claims Mr Milburn is unwilling to allow any new role for the chancellor to come at his expense. Mr Johnson told BBC News: ""Gordon Brown will play a central role in any election campaign.

" Carlos Moya became the first man to successfully defend the Chennai Open title by beating four-times finalist Paradorn Srichaphan 3-6 6-4 7-6 (7/5).  The Spaniard then donated his £28,000 prize money to relief efforts for the victims of the Asian tsunami. The final was close throughout, with Thai second seed Srichaphan - the 2003 winner - closing out the first set. But Moya took the second set, before bouncing back from 5-2 down in the decider to force and win a tie-break. Moya confirmed afterwards: ""I'm donating my prize money from this tournament for the tsunami victims, hoping it makes some difference to their lives. His contribution follows pledges by four other players to donate their prize money from the tournament, which went ahead after the 26 December disaster which has so far claimed at least 150,000 lives. Scrichapan said he would donate an unspecified amount for relief work in Thailand, where more than 5,000 people were killed. The ATP has announced that it would contribute the US$25,000 tournament fee to Unicef's emergency relief fund in Tamil Nadu. The ATP Tour's sponsor, Mercedes, said it would also contribute, increasing the ATP donation to US$40,000. ",human,news
" Organisers say this year's Berlin Film Festival, which opens on Thursday with period epic Man to Man, will celebrate a revitalised European cinema.  Of the 21 films in competition for the Golden and Silver Bear awards, more than half are from Europe with France particularly well represented. Festival director Dieter Kosslick says this strong showing signals ""a new consciousness for European films"". ""They're on an incredible winning streak,"" he told the Reuters agency. ""This isn't to say there aren't any good American films,"" he continued. ""It's just that there are more good European films.""  However, Mr Kosslick refused to accept that widespread opposition to the Iraq war had turned audiences against Hollywood imports. ""There is no anti-American mood,"" he said. Some 350 films will be screened at this year's festival, with a further 300 shown at the European Film Market that runs alongside it. More than a dozen celebrities are scheduled to attend, among them Will Smith, Kevin Spacey and Keanu Reeves. But Mr Kosslick says more would be coming had the Academy Awards not been brought forward to 27 February. ""I'm not worried that we won't be able to fill the red carpet with stars,"" he said, though he admitted the festival may be moved to January next year to avoid a similar clash.

" Foreign Secretary Jack Straw will visit Auschwitz for the 60th anniversary of the former Nazi concentration camp's liberation, it has been announced.  Prince Edward will also join the UK delegation in Poland for National Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January. Between 1.1 and 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, were killed at Auschwitz. The Tories said they were glad Mr Straw had been ""shamed"" into going, having earlier criticised the decision to send a lower-ranking official. Shadow Foreign Secretary Michael Ancram said: ""I am glad the foreign secretary has finally been shamed into representing Britain at this important act of commemoration. ""Once again this government has shown crass insensitivity until it has been forced by public opinion into doing what it should have done in the first place.""  In Britain, the Queen and Prince Philip will lead the nation's commemoration at a service in Westminster Hall, London. The Queen will also host a reception for holocaust survivors at St James's Palace. Altogether, some six million people, mainly Jews, perished in the Holocaust. The Queen's grandson, Prince Harry, sparked outrage earlier this week after photographs of him wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party emerged. The prince, 20, apologised, but critics have called for him to go to Auschwitz for the commemoration of the Soviets' 1945 liberation of the camp. Prince Harry should see for himself ""the results of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear"", Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of Jewish human rights group the Simon Wiesenthal Center said.

" US rapper Snoop Dogg has been sued for $25m (£13m) by a make-up artist who claimed he and his entourage drugged and raped her two years ago.  The woman said she was assaulted after a recording of the Jimmy Kimmel Live TV show on the ABC network in 2003. The rapper's spokesman said the allegations were ""untrue"" and the woman was ""misusing the legal system as a means of extracting financial gain"". ABC said the claims had ""no merit"". The star has not been charged by police.  The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles on Friday, says the woman's champagne was spiked and she was then assaulted. The rapper's spokesperson said: ""Snoop will have the opportunity to prove in a court of law that [the alleged victim] is opportunistic and deceitful. ""We are confident that in this case, [the alleged victim's] claims against Snoop Dogg will be rejected."" The lawsuit names Snoop Dogg - real name Calvin Broadus - plus three associates, The Walt Disney Company and its parent company ABC Inc.  The woman waited two years to sue because she was trying to negotiate a settlement with the media companies, her lawyer, Perry Wander, said. Disney and ABC ""failed to provide a safe working environment for my client,"" he said. The legal action comes after the rap star sued a woman who claimed they tried to blackmail him to keep quiet about an alleged assault. The 32-year-old rapper has enjoyed six US top 10 albums since bursting onto the music scene with hit songs like What's My Name? and Gin and Juice in 1993. ",human,news

The company, which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, is seeking people aged 18 to 99. The Canada-based company says it was looking for ""a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters"". Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performer's fee for the use of their image. The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification.

Hundreds of photos of the person's head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D.

She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. ""We cannot give people any control over how the images are used.

" Betty Boothroyd has said the House of Lords needs its own Speaker and that peers should lead the way on reforming the upper chamber.  Baroness Boothroyd, who was the first woman to be Commons Speaker, said she believed Tony Blair initiated reforms without a clear outcome in mind. ""Now we have to take care of it ourselves and make the best of it,"" she told the BBC's Breakfast with Frost. In 1999 Labour removed all but 92 of the Lords' 750 hereditary peers.

" More than 1,000 people turned out on Sunday to pay tribute to late US TV presenter Johnny Carson in the Nebraska town where he grew up.  Carson, who hosted the Tonight Show for 30 years, died on 23 January from respiratory disease emphysema. He lived in Norfolk, Nebraska from the age of eight until he joined the Navy, but returned regularly and donated $5m (£2.7m) to local causes. Old school friends were among the crowd at the school's Johnny Carson Theater.  Carson, who was one of the best-loved TV personalities in the US, asked not to have a public memorial in Los Angeles, where he lived in later life. He began his showbusiness career in Norfolk, performing magic under the name The Great Carsoni from the age of 14. His donations included $600,000 to Norfolk High School in the 1980s to build a new performing arts centre. When Carson died, President Bush led the public tributes, saying the presenter ""had a profound influence on American life and entertainment"". ",human,news
" A European Parliament committee has ordered a rewrite of the proposals for controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.  The Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the Commission should re-submit the Computer Implemented Inventions Directive after MEPs failed to back it. It has had vocal critics who say it could favour large over small firms and impact open-source software innovation. Supporters say it would let firms protect their inventions. The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, ""computer implemented invention"". The draft law suffered setbacks when Poland, one of the largest EU member states, rejected its adoption twice in two months. Intense lobbying on the issue has started to gain momentum in some national parliaments putting them under immense pressure. Only two MEPs backed the draft law at the JURI meeting, with one voting to abstain.  Opponents of the draft directive welcomed the decision and said a new first reading of the proposals would give the EU a chance to have fuller debates about its implications in all member states. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its ""one-click shopping"" service, for example. Critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in Europe. This, they fear, could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US. ",human,news

" Britain's £3bn EU rebate is not up for renegotiation at next week's European Council summit, Jack Straw said.  The foreign secretary told MPs the rebate, secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984, was ""entirely justified"". New European commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has suggested the cash could be shared out among net contributors to the EU budget. Mr Straw acknowledged some countries in the newly enlarged 25 nation EU still had to ""see the light"" on the rebate.  But the foreign secretary told the Commons foreign affairs committee: ""Our position is very clear: it is entirely justified and it is not for negotiation."" He added that he did not think there would be a political price to pay for the UK's stance - Britain contributed more and received less than other EU states. The two-day European Council summit in Brussels begins on 16 December and is widely expected to mark the beginning of a lengthy negotiating period over the EU's budget for 2007-13. The wrangling could stretch into 2005, even 2006.  The UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the Commission wants it to be 1.26%. Mr Straw said the EU commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget. ""I don't know of any national government thinking of increasing its budget by that amount,"" he added. The foreign secretary said he hoped the talks next week could produce a date in 2005 for the beginning of negotiations with Turkey about possible EU membership although that there would be no prospect of a date for joining for some time.

" The makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home PCs could face hefty fines in California.  From 1 January, a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware. The legislation, which was approved by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information. Spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing PC users in the coming year. The software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information. At its worst, it has the ability to hijack personal data, like passwords, login details and credit card numbers. The programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate.  One form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer user's web-surfing. It can result in people being bombarded with pop-up ads that are hard to close. In Washington, Congress has been debating four anti-spyware bills, but California is a step ahead. The state's Consumer Protection Against Spyware Act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer. It also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware. Consumers are able to seek up to $1,000 in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software. The new law marks a continuing trend in California towards tougher privacy rights. A recent survey by Earthlink and Webroot found that 90% of PCs are infested with the surreptitious software and that, on average, each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs. Currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as Spybot and Ad-Aware. ",human,news
" General Motors has warned that it expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004.  The world's biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European business, and weak US sales. GM said higher healthcare costs in North America, and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005. GM said it expects to meet its 2004 earnings targets ""despite a tough competitive environment"".  GM, whose brands include Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet in the US and Opel, Saab and Vauxhall in Europe, is due to reveal 2004 earnings on 19 January.  It said it would deliver a shareholder payout of $6.0-$6.5 per share this year, as promised, but that next year's earnings per share would be lower, at between $4.0-$5.0. ""We're following a roadmap that we believe will deliver strong results,"" said GM chief executive Rick Waggoner. GM said it was expecting ""reduced financial losses"" in Europe in 2005. It is in the midst of cutting 12,000 jobs - one fifth of the European total - in a bid to cut costs. The biggest job losses are in Germany. Its vehicle businesses have gained market share in three out of four regions in 2004, achieving record profitability in Asia Pacific and returning to profit in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. The car maker has diversified into financial services, and is extending the reach of General Motors Acceptance Corp (GMAC), which has said it may enter the home loans market. GMAC has been a strong contributor to profits in 2004 but GM said it will do less well this year, delivering net income of $2.5bn. ""Attaining earnings of $10 a share remains GM's goal,"" the company said, adding it believes it can achieve this in 2007. ",human,news
" Murdered director Theo van Gogh's controversial film Submission has been pulled from the Rotterdam Film Festival because of security fears.  It was one of three of his works to be shown as part of a freedom of expression event in tribute to the late film-maker's life. The film is critical of the treatment of women under Islam. Its TV screening is thought to have led to his murder. The 10-day Dutch festival begins on Wednesday. Submission was made with liberal Somali-Dutch politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali and was due to be shown on 30 January. Van Gogh was shot and stabbed to death in November 2004 several months after receiving death threats following Submission's first broadcast on Dutch television. Two of Van Gogh's other films will be shown as planned, including the theatrical world premiere of his last feature 06/05.

" News Corp, the media company controlled by Australian billionaire Rupert Murdoch, is eyeing a move into the video games market.  According to the Financial Times, chief operating officer Peter Chernin said that News Corp is ""kicking the tyres of pretty much all video games companies"". Santa Monica-based Activison is said to be one firm on its takeover list. Video games are ""big business"", the paper quoted Mr Chernin as saying. We ""would like to get into it"".  The success of products such as Sony's Playstation, Microsoft's X-Box and Nintendo's Game Cube have boosted demand for video games. The days of arcade classics such as Space Invaders, Pac-Man and Donkey Kong are long gone. Today, games often have budgets big enough for feature films and look to give gamers as real an experience as possible. And with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies, video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun.  Mr Chernin, however, told the FT that News Corp was finding it difficult to identify a suitable target. ""We are struggling with the gap between companies like Electronic Arts (EA), which comes with a high price tag, and the next tier of companies,"" he explained during a conference in Phoenix, Arizona. ""These may be too focused on one or two product lines."" Activision has a stock market capitalisation of about $2.95bn (£1.57bn), compared to EA's $17.8bn. Some of the games industry's main players have recently been looking to consolidate their position by making acquisitions. France's Ubisoft, one of Europe's biggest video game publishers, has been trying to remain independent since Electronic Arts announced plans to buy 19.9% of the firm.

" India has signed a $40bn (£21bn) deal to import millions of tonnes of liquefied natural gas from Iran.  Firms led by the Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will also assist in the development of Iranian oil fields. Ministers, eager to gain access to energy supplies to meet the demands of a booming economy, secured a similar deal to one between Iran and China. The announcement comes as ONGC said it was in talks to buy former assets of troubled Russian oil firm Yukos. The agreements with Iran were sealed after talks in New Delhi between Middle East producers and Asia's biggest energy consumers - China, India, Japan and South Korea.  Iran - Opec's second-biggest oil producer and one of the world's top gas producers - has been pursuing a series of deals, rewarding LNG buyers with participation in development of its oil fields. Under the agreement, it will supply India with 7.5 million tonnes of LPG annually over a 25 year period from 2009. ONGC and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) reached a preliminary deal for Indian firms to take part in the development of the Yadavaran and Jufeyr oilfields, both countries said in a statement. India's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. Consumption has jumped to 2.4 million barrels per day, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973. ",human,news
" A US TV network is editing BBC Films' Dirty War to avoid showing the front of a nude woman being scrubbed down after a fictional chemical attack.  It is not worth showing ""non-essential"" nude scenes when indecency complaints are ""aggressively pursued"" by US TV watchdogs, said PBS' Jacoba Atlas. Dirty War - screened uncut on BBC One last September - depicts a dirty bomb attack on the City of London. It is also being screened uncut on US cable channel HBO on 24 January. PBS said it will use extra footage for its broadcast, showing the woman ""from a more discreet angle"" instead.  The US Federal Communications Commission fined CBS $550,000 (£306,814) last autumn for singer Janet Jackson's ""wardrobe malfunction"", during which her breast was exposed during a dance routine with Justin Timberlake. Many US networks and broadcasters are now more nervous about airing nudity, violence or bad language. Ms Atlas said PBS could put itself financially at risk if it showed the uncut version of Dirty War, and it could also deter many of its 170 individual stations from airing ""an important film"". ""You want to pick your battles,"" she said. She added that PBS, which is a private, non-profit media enterprise owned and operated by the nation's 349 public television stations, is bolder about screening non-fiction or historical programming. PBS is seen in virtually all US homes with TV, and describes itself as a ""trusted community resource"" serving nearly 100 million people each week. ",human,news

Frank Capra's 1946 movie starring James Stewart, is being turned into a £7m musical by producer Jon Thoday. He is working with Steve Brown, who wrote the award-winning musical Spend Spend Spend. A spokeswoman said the plans were in the ""very early stages"", with no cast, opening date or theatre announced.  A series of workshops have been held in London, and on Wednesday a cast of singers unveiled the musical to a select group of potential investors. Mr Thoday said the idea of turning the film into a musical had been an ambition of his for almost 20 years. It's a Wonderful Life was based on a short story, The Greatest Gift, by Philip van Doren Stern. Mr Thoday managed to buy the rights to the story from Van Doren Stern's family in 1999, following Mr Brown's success with Spend Spend Spend. He later secured the film rights from Paramount, enabling them to use the title It's A Wonderful Life. ",human,news
" An executive at US insurance firm Marsh & McLennan has pleaded guilty to criminal charges in connection with an ongoing fraud and bid-rigging probe.  New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer said senior vice president Robert Stearns had pleaded guilty to scheming to defraud. The offence carries a sentence of 16 months to four years in state prison. Mr Spitzer's office added Mr Stearns had also agreed to testify in future cases during the industry inquiry. ""We are saddened by the development,"" Marsh said in a statement. The company added it would continue to co-operate in the case, adding it was ""committed to resolving the company's legal issues and to serving our clients with the highest standards of transparency and ethics"".  According to a statement from Mr Spitzer's office, the Marsh executive admitted he instructed insurance companies to submit non-competitive bids for insurance business between 2002 and 2004. Those bids were then ""conveyed to Marsh clients under false and fraudulent pretences"". Through the practice, Marsh was allowed to determine which insurers won business from clients, and so control the insurance market, Mr Spitzer's office added. It also protected incumbent insurers when their business was up for renewal and helped Marsh to maximise its fees, a statement said. In one case, an email showed Mr Stearns had instructed a colleague to solicit a non-competitive - or ""B"" - quote from AIG that was ""higher in premium and more restrictive in coverage"" and so fixed the bids in a way that would support the present provider Chubb. The company is also still being examined by US stock market regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Late last month the SEC asked for information about transactions involving holders of 5% or more of the firm's shares. ",human,news
" India will allow domestic commercial airlines to fly long haul international routes, a move it hopes will stoke competition and drive down prices.  However, only state controlled carriers will be able to fly the lucrative Gulf routes, to countries such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, for at least three years. Jet Airways and Air Sahara are the two companies that will benefit initially. India is looking to develop its airline industry as booming economic growth drives demand for travel.  Monica Chadha, BBC Delhi reporter, said air travel in India had increased by almost 20% from the previous year and was expected to rise even further. Infrastructure development is lagging demand, however, and will have to improve. ""Most international airports in the country are shabby and ill-equipped to handle heavy air traffic,"" Ms Chada said, adding that while the Civil Aviation minister has promised to modernise and privatise airports little progress has been made. Steps have been take to move things forward and the government recently changed legislation that limited foreign investment in domestic airlines. It raised the maximum stake holding allowed to 49% from 40%. Local press, meanwhile, have reported that the US and India will start negotiations about adding more routes in January. Jet Airways is India's premier private domestic carrier; Air Sahara is ranked third in the category. ",human,news
" The ongoing public spat between the two heirs of India's biggest conglomerate, Reliance Group, has spilled over to the board meeting of a leading company within the group.  Anil Ambani, vice-chairman of India Petrochemicals Limited (IPCL), stayed away from a gathering of senior managers on Thursday. The move follows a decision earlier this month by Anil - the younger brother of Reliance Group president Mukesh Ambani - to resign from his post. His resignation was not accepted by his brother, who is also the boss of IPCL. The IPCL board met in Mumbai to discuss the company's results for the October-to-December quarter.  It is understood that the board also considered Anil's resignation and asked him to reconsider his decision. However, Anil's demand that Anand Jain - another IPCL board member accused by Anil of creating a rift in the Ambani family - be thrown out, was not met. Anil has accused Anand Jain, a confidant of his brother Mukesh, of playing a negative role in the Ambani family, and being responsible for the trouble between the brothers. On Wednesday, the board of Reliance Energy, another Reliance Group company, reaffirmed its faith in Anil, who is the company's chief. Reliance Group acquired the government's 26% stake in IPCL - India's second-largest petrochemicals company - in 2002, as part of the privatisation drive. Meanwhile, the group's flagship company, Reliance Industries, has its board meeting on Friday to consider its financial results. Mukesh is the company's chairman and Anil its deputy, and it is expected that both brothers will come face to face in the meeting. The Ambani family controls 48% of the group, which is worth $17bn (£9.1bn; 745bn Indian rupees). It was founded by their father, Dhiru Bhai Ambani, who died two years ago. ",human,news
" Chancellor Gordon Brown will deliver his Budget to the House of Commons on 16 March, the Treasury has announced.  The Budget, likely to be the last before the General Election, will be at 1230 GMT on that Wednesday, just after Prime Minister's question time. The annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government's taxation and broader economic predictions. It is likely to set out much of the tax and spending battleground for the election, widely expected on 5 May.  Next month's Budget will be Mr Brown's eighth since Labour came to power in 1997. If a May election is called, there could be as little as 18 days between the Budget and the announcement of a date for the election. A shortened Finance Bill would have to be rushed through Parliament with all-party support to allow the Government to continue collecting revenue. The full Finance Bill, with the Budget measures in it, would then be returned to the Commons after the election, if Labour secures another term in office. As Mr Brown announced the Budget date in a short ministerial statement, accountancy firm Ernst & Young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the long-term requirements of the economy. ""In the Budgets that were given immediately before the last six elections, taxes were cut by the incumbent chancellor and, in many cases, taxes were increased soon after the election result,"" said Aidan O'Carroll, E&Y's UK head of tax.

" Ex-Labour MP George Galloway has appealed for the release of aid worker Margaret Hassan, kidnapped in Iraq.  Mrs Hassan, 59, who led Care International operations in Iraq, was abducted in Baghdad on 19 October. Mr Galloway was expelled from the Labour party because of his staunch opposition to the war on Iraq. He denied an earlier report that he planned to make a direct appeal to the kidnappers via the Al-Jazeera Arabic television channel.  Speaking in London on Saturday at the first annual delegate conference of his newly-founded party, the Respect Coalition, he said: ""I have deliberately not involved myself before in any of these situations. ""But this woman has been a prominent opponent of both the war and the preceding years of sanctions. ""I am prepared to do anything I can to help save her life."" A spokesman later said Mr Galloway had friends in common with Ms Hassan, who he described as a prominent anti-war activist, and that he was ""willing to do anything - go to Iraq or be an intermediary or anything that's necessary"". Since her abduction, several videos of Mrs Hassan have been broadcast by Al-Jazeera. The latest footage showed Mrs Hassan asking for British troops to be pulled out of Iraq. She also urged Care International, the aid agency she works for, to close its office in Baghdad, and appealed for Iraqi women prisoners to be freed. Care has since closed down all its operations in Iraq. ",human,news
" IBM is spending $100m (£52m) over the next three years beefing up its commitment to Linux software.  The cash injection will be used to help its customers use Linux on every type of device from handheld computers and phones right up to powerful servers. IBM said the money will fund a variety of technical, research and marketing initiatives to boost Linux use. IBM said it had taken the step in response to greater customer demand for the open source software.  In 2004 IBM said it had seen double digit growth in the number of customers using Linux to help staff work together more closely. The money will be used to help this push towards greater collaboration and will add Linux-based elements to IBM's Workplace software. Workplace is a suite of programs and tools that allow workers to get at core business applications no matter what device they use to connect to corporate networks. One of the main focuses of the initiative will be to make it easier to use Linux-based desktop computers and mobile devices with Workplace. Even before IBM announced this latest spending boost it was one of the biggest advocates of the open source way of working. In 2001 it put $300m into a three-year Linux program and has produced Linux versions of many of its programs. Linux and the open source software movement are based on the premise that developers should be free to tinker with the core components of software programs. They reason that more open scrutiny of software produces better programs and fuels innovation. ",human,news
" Deutsche Boerse investors unhappy with its London Stock Exchange bid will have no chance to throw out the exchange's management until May, Reuters says.  The Sunday Times reported that hedge funds TCI and Atticus were planning to demand the removal of the group's chairman and chief executive. But Deutsche Boerse told news agency Reuters such a move would have to wait until May's annual general meeting. Investors want Deutsche to return cash to shareholders rather than bid. ""We are long-term investors and are experienced in removing management. We are not scared to take this to its conclusion this time,"" Atticus' David Slager told the Sunday Times. However, Deutsche Boerse told Reuters: ""TCI's request for the removal of the supervisory board will be considered at the annual general meeting on May 25.""  The Sunday Times reported that TCI had been drawing up a list of heavyweight executives to replace Deutsche's chairman Rolf Breuer and chief executive Werner Seifert. The group owns more than 5% of Deutsche - more than enough to demand an extraordinary general meeting to call on shareholders to oust the German exchange's management. Under German law Deutsche does not need investor backing to make a takeover bid. TCI and Atticus have opposed the LSE bid for some time saying it would destroy shareholder value, and would be better spent on a share buyback. Deutsche is in competition with pan-European bourse Euronext to take over the London exchange. Many commentators have suggested a bidding war between the two could break out. However, any such move would have to wait until March when the Office of Fair Trading completes an investigation into the competition aspects of the pair's takeover proposals. ",human,news
" French stock market regulator AMF has filed complaints against media giant Vivendi Universal, its boss and another top executive.  It believes the prospectus for a bond issue was unclear and that executives may have had privileged information. AMF has begun proceedings against Vivendi, its chief executive Jean-Rene Fourtou and chief operating officer Jean-Bernard Levy. Vivendi advisor Deutsche Bank was also the subject of a complaint filing. Deutsche Bank, which was responsible for selling the convertible bonds to investors, could face penalties if the complaint is upheld.  Vivendi has said it believes there is ""no legal basis"" for the complaints. The watchdog is said to believe the executive pair were party to ""privileged information"" surrounding the issue of the bonds. Both men bought some of the bonds, the Associated Press news agency reported. AMF is investigating claims that the duo were aware of an interest in Vivendi's US assets from investor Marvin Davis, at the time of the bond sale. Vivendi, however, has said that the information was public knowledge as Mr Davis' offer for the US assets had already been rejected by Vivendi's board. AMF is also looking into whether the executives knew that Vivendi was considering exercising its right to buy British Telecom's shares in Cegetel. Vivendi has rejected the charge, saying the decision to buy the Cegetel shares was ""no more than a possibility, of which the public was perfectly aware"" at the time of the bond issue. Back in December, Vivendi and its former chief executive Jean-Marie Messier were each fined 1m euros ($1.3m; £690,000) by AMF. The fines came after a 15-month probe into allegations that the media giant misled investors after a costly acquisition programme went wrong. ",human,news

" The number of personal computers worldwide is expected to double by 2010 to 1.3 billion machines, according to a report by analysts Forrester Research.  The growth will be driven by emerging markets such as China, Russia and India, the report predicted. More than a third of all new PCs will be in these markets, with China adding 178 million new PCs by 2010, it said. Low-priced computers made by local companies are expected to dominate in such territories, Forrester said. The report comes less than a week after IBM, a pioneer of the PC business, sold its PC hardware division to China's number one computer maker Lenovo.  The $1.75bn (£900m) deal will make the combined operation the third biggest PC vendor in the world. ""Today's products from Western PC vendors won't dominate in those markets in the long term,"" Simon Yates, a senior analyst for Forrester, said. ""Instead local PC makers like Lenovo Group in China and Aquarius in Russia that can better tailor the PC form factor, price point and applications to their local markets will ultimately win the market share battle,"" he said. There are currently 575 million PCs in use globally. The United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific are expected to add 150 million new PCs by 2010, according to the study. The report forecast that there will be 80 million new PC users in India by 2010 and 40 million new users in Indonesia. ",human,news
" Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, is to be released in 50 countries around the world, its distributor has said.  Howl's Moving Castle set a Japanese box office record last week, taking 1.5bn yen (£7.7m) in its first two days. Miyazaki won an Oscar earlier this year for Spirited Away, Japan's first Academy Award for nearly 50 years. Howl's Moving Castle is based on a children's fantasy novel by UK author Diana Wynne Jones. It tells the story of an 18-year-old woman who ages dramatically after falling under a witch's spell. She heads to a moving castle kept by Howl, a wizard, and searches for a way to become normal again.

" Madagascar has completed the replacement of its Malagasy franc with a new currency, the ariary.  From Monday, all prices and contracts will have to be quoted in the ariary, which was trading at 1,893 to the US dollar. The Malagasy franc, which lost almost half its value in 2004, is no longer legal tender but will remain exchangeable at banks until 2009. The phasing out of the franc, begun in July 2003, was intended to distance the country from its past under French colonial rule and address the problem of the large amount of counterfeit francs in circulation. ""It's above all a question of sovereignty,"" Reuters quoted a central bank official as saying. ""It is symbolic of our independence from the old colonial ways. Since we left the French monetary zone in 1973 we should have our own currency with its own name."" The ariary was the name of a pre-colonial currency in the Indian Ocean island state. ",human,news
" The European Parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.  Politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law. During consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped. The bill was backed by some hi-tech firms, saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile.  Hugo Lueders, European director for public policy at CompTIA, an umbrella organization for technology companies, said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would European inventors prosper. He said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. Other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the American system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software. But opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation, be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement. The proposed law had a troubled passage through the European parliament. Its progress was delayed twice when Polish MEPs rejected plans to adopt it. Also earlier this month the influential European Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of MEPs. To become law both the European Parliament and a qualified majority of EU states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill. The latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the EU for re-consideration. ",human,news
" Plans to portray Dominica's Carib Indians as cannibals in the sequel to hit film Pirates of the Caribbean have been criticised by the group's chief.  Carib Chief Charles Williams said talks with Disney's producers revealed there was ""a strong element of cannibalism in the script which cannot be removed"". The Caribbean island's government said Disney planned to film in Dominica. The Caribs have long denied their ancestors practised cannibalism. Disney was unavailable for comment. ""Our ancestors stood up against early European conquerors and because they stood up...we were labelled savages and cannibals up to today,"" said Mr Williams.  ""This cannot be perpetuated in movies."" Shooting on the sequel is expected to begin in April, with hundreds of Dominicans applying to be extras in the movie.  About 3,000 Caribs live on the island of Dominica, which has a population of 70,000. Many Caribs were killed by disease and war during colonisation up to the 1600s. Mr Williams said he had received support from indigenous groups around the world in his efforts to have cannibalism references removed from the film. But he admitted there were some members of the Carib council who did not support the campaign. He said some did not ""understand our history, they are weak and are not committed to the cause of the Carib people"".

" Chinese police have detained three top executives at milk firm Yili, with reports suggesting that they are being investigated for embezzlement.  Yili - full name Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial - confirmed its chairman, chief financial officer and securities representative were all in custody. The company, China's third-largest milk producer, is to hold an emergency meeting to debate the issue. A Yili spokesman said it may now move to oust chairman Zheng Junhuai. The spokesman did not say why the three had been detained by the police. The official Xinhua News Agency said the arrest was linked to alleged embezzlement.

" French consumers increased their spending by 1.5% in January, a figure which bodes well for the country's economic growth, figures revealed.  The National Statistic Institute (INSEE) added that consumer spending in January rose 3.8% on a year-on-year basis. Rising sales of household equipment were behind the increase. The INSEE also said that French consumer prices fell 0.6% in January, but were up 1.6% on an annual basis.  Despite the general increase in spending in January, French households bought fewer cars in January. According to the INSEE, car sales fell 2.8% in January, following a fall of 0.6% in December. But on a year-on-year basis, the sector still saw a sales increase of 6.5%. Consumer spending fuelled France's economic growth in the last quarter of 2004 and analysts expect that it will continue to support the economy. ""It's a growth that will remain fragile and vulnerable to risks like a strong rise in long-term interest rates, tension in the oil price,"" Emmanuel Ferry, from Exane BNP Paribas told Reuters news agency.

" The first convictions for piracy over peer-to-peer networks have been handed down in the US.  New Yorker William Trowbridge and Texan Michael Chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. The two men faced charges following raids in August on suspected pirates by the FBI. The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250,000 (£130,000) fine.  In a statement the US Department of Justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the Direct Connect peer-to-peer network. The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. Direct Connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. Users would swap files, such as films and music, by exchanging data over the network. During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies, 40 software programs, 13 games and 178 ""sound recordings"" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. The raids were organised under the umbrella of Operation Digital Gridlock which was aimed at fighting ""criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks"". In total, six raids were carried out in August. Five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. The Department of Justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. They also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage. The two men are due to be sentenced on 29 April. ",human,news
" Climate change could be completely out of control within several decades, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency is warning a committee of MSPs.  Experts are giving evidence on the subject to the Scottish Parliament's environment committee. Officials believe nuclear energy and wind farms may be better options than trying to tackle global warming. Solutions suggested by conservationists include reducing internal UK air travel and boosting electric trains. The evidence is part of the committee's inquiry into the impact of climate change in Scotland. Sepa is attempting to curb global warming gases, as pollution from transport emissions increases.  Ecologists are warning MSPs that Scotland may have to accept ""significant intrusion"" from wind farms. It is likely also that nuclear power will be needed for possibly several decades. Sepa predict that the two methods will remain as energy sources until climate change is under control.

" Singers Jennifer Lopez and husband Marc Anthony, a Latin pop star, are to perform a duet at this month's Grammy Awards in Los Angeles.  Anthony became Lopez's third husband in June 2004. He won a Grammy in 1998 and is nominated for two more this year. The 13 February ceremony will also include a rendition of The Beatles' Across The Universe by Bono, Stevie Wonder, Norah Jones and Brian Wilson. The song will go on sale online to raise money for the tsunami aid effort. The awards show will also feature performances from U2, Green Day, Alicia Keys and Kanye West - but the Lopez and Anthony duet is likely to be one of the biggest talking points.  Anthony, born in New York to a Puerto Rican family, is reported to be the biggest-selling salsa artist of all time. He is nominated this year for best Latin pop album and best salsa/merengue album. The tsunami tribute song will also feature Alicia Keys, Velvet Revolver and Tim McGraw. Fans will be able to download it for $0.99 (£0.53) from iTunes, or purchase the video from the CBS TV network's site. Kanye West, the rapper who leads the awards with 10 nominations, will perform alongside John Legend, Mavis Staples and the Blind Boys of Alabama. There will also be a tribute to Ray Charles featuring Bonnie Raitt and Billy Preston and a celebration of southern rock with Tim McGraw, Gretchen Wilson, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Dickie Betts and Elvis Bishop. Ray Charles, who died in June 2004, has seven posthumous nominations. Alicia Keys and Usher share eight nominations each. ",human,news
" Second seed Joachim Johansson won his second career title with a 7-5 6-3 win over Taylor Dent at the Australian hardcourt championships in Adelaide.  The Swede was made to graft, American Dent surviving three break points in the fifth game of the match. But Johansson got the breakthrough with a sublime backhand return winner and won the second set with more ease. His first tournament win was at Memphis in 2004, helping him leap from 113th in the world rankings to number 11. Afterwards, Dent said he rated US Open semi-finalist Johansson as a top contender at the Australian Open, which starts on 17 January. ""I believe men's tennis is all about holding serve and if he's playing like that on his own serve I don't see how guys are going to break him,"" said Dent. Johansson was more restrained in his assessment: ""I have to improve my serve if I'm going to go all the way in Melbourne."" ",human,news

The Russian, ranked sixth in the world, broke Williams three times in the first set, while losing her service once. Williams saved three championship points before losing the match at the Victoria Park tennis court. ""It's really a great start to the year no matter whether it's an exhibition or not. I was trying to play my best and I really did it,"" said Dementieva. ""This will give me all the confidence before the Grand Slams. I was trying so hard to win this tournament."" Williams, 24, was disappointed with her display. ""She played some nice points, but it was mostly me committing unforced errors - four or five errors in each game,"" she said. Before the match, organizers auctioned off rackets belonging to the players, raising £115,000 for victims of the tsunami disaster. ",human,news
" The New York music studio where John Lennon spent his final hours is to close next month.  The Hit Factory, which opened 37 years ago, has played host to some of the biggest stars in music, including Paul Simon, Madonna and David Bowie. However, the rise in digital recording has affected business at the studio, which is relocating to smaller premises in Miami. Lennon recorded his final album Double Fantasy at the studio in 1979.  The studio was founded by Jerry Ragovoy in 1968. In 1975 it was sold to fellow producer Edward Germano, who turned it into a 100,000 square foot studio with seven recording rooms and live mastering suites. His first client was Stevie Wonder, who recorded part of his classic album Songs In The Key Of Life there. Other well-known albums to be recorded or partially recorded at the studio include Bruce Springsteen's Born In The USA, the Rolling Stones' Emotional Rescue and Paul Simon's Graceland. Michael Jackson, Billy Joel, Jay-Z and Beyonce are also among artists who have used the Hit Factory in the past, as well as 50 Cent who survived an attempt on his life as he left the premises in 2000. The studio made history in 1994 when it won a record 41 Grammy nominations for songs recorded, mastered or mixed there, including the soundtrack to the Whitney Houston film The Bodyguard.

" EuroDisney, the European home of Mickey Mouse and friends, has said it will sell 253m euros (£175m; $328m) of new shares as it looks to avoid insolvency.  The sale is the last part of a plan to restructure 2.4bn euros-worth of debts. Despite struggling since it was opened in 1992, EuroDisney has recently made progress in turning its business around and ticket sales have picked up. However, analysts still question whether it attracts enough visitors to stay open, even with the restructuring.  EuroDisney remains Europe's largest single tourist attraction, attracting some 12.4 million visitors annually. A new attraction - Walt Disney Studios - has recently opened its site near Paris. The company's currently traded stock tumbled in Paris on the latest news, shedding 15% to 22 euro cents. EuroDisney will sell the new shares priced at 9 euros cents each. The US Disney Corporation and Saudi Arabian prince Al-Walid bin Talal, the firm's two main shareholders, will buy the new stock. The restructuring deal is the second in the firm's troubled financial history; its finances were first reorganised in 1994. ",human,news
" A controversial film starring Hollywood actor Kevin Bacon as a convicted paedophile won top honours at the London Film Festival on Thursday.  The Woodsman won the Satyajit Ray Award, named after the Indian director. The low-budget film, directed by Nicole Kassell, is about a convicted child molester trying to rebuild his life after 12 years in jail. Judges said the film tackled the contentious subject with ""great insight and sensitivity"". Previous films to take the prize include the Oscar-winning Boys Don't Cry, which was about the true life story of murdered transsexual Brandon Teena.  British writer-director Amma Asante won the UK Film Talent Award this year for her debut feature A Way Of Life. Set in South Wales, the film is about a teenage single mother who becomes embroiled in a tense stand-off with a Turkish neighbour. Also on Thursday night, the Fipresci International Critics Awards went to Aaltra, a Belgian film about the handicapped; and the Sutherland Trophy, which was won by Jonathan Caouette for his film Tarnation. The festival closed with a screening of the film I Heart Huckabees, starring Jude Law and Dustin Hoffman and directed by Three Kings film-maker David O Russell. The festival this year also included the first European screening of the new Pixar animation The Incredibles, and the British film Bullet Boy, starring So Solid Crew rapper Asher D. ",human,news
"Yes, it is somewhat hard to imaging Penelope Ann Miller even considering any type of relationship with Danny DeVito.  And yes, they really do not explore the apparent rift between Peck's character and Miller's.  These two caveats aside, this is a very enjoyable movie.  So all tycoons don't look like Richard Gere.  This is a tour de force for DeVito.  He gets past his diminutive stature and actually becomes Larry the Liquidator.  I was not saddled with having seen (or even heard of) the play.  Theater is irrelevant anyway, except as a training ground for movie actors.  I took this picture on its own merits, and frankly, I was skeptical that DeVito could do a corporate raider.  But he plays it just right and then has you believing that this dwarf from the Bronx really made good.  Dean Jones is convincing as the corporate soldier trying to find a soft place to land. Peck is excellent, as always.Two thumbs up!",human,reviews

Some of my friends knew him from Takeshis Castle (a TV show that is quite mental). But there is also this dramatic side to him, that is slow and silent (and even philosophical, though that can also be said about his Yakuza movies).So whether you know him or not, may play a role in how you perceive this.

This was one of a handful of shorts in the Ham and Hattie series done by the UPA studio. There will be mild spoilers ahead: The Ham and Hattie shorts were actually two shorter cartoons paired together and set to music.Sailing is the Hattie short. Hattie plays with a toy sailboat in a fountain while a song about sailing plays over the cartoon. The sailboat gets sunk but a policeman saves the day for Hattie.Village Band is about a band in a small village. They aren't appreciated by their fellow citizens until they suddenly realize that a village band is needed to play for the arrival of a visiting dignitary. The musicians save the day and are then celebrated by the people who basically ignored them before.This short can be found on a three disc box set of Jolly Frolics shorts. The set is excellent and this short is well worth watching. Recommended.,human,reviews
"...And I think that this is what Scary Movie here is trying to prove to us. Many scriptwriters think that by making a character do a stupid decision is going to make the movie a lot scarier, but unfortunately, the movie is usually ruined because of those stupid actions. Take Carmen Electra, at the beginning, for example. Why the hell did she have to take the banana while there was a couple of other weapons that were a lot better, such as a handgun? It just shows a great example to not imitate. The acting was pretty good: The Wayans brothers, Anna Faris and many other were pretty good at imitating mediocre actors. Overall, Scary Movie is a really good choice to look at if you just watched a horror movie and felt really, really disappointed.",human,reviews
"I first saw the French action star in Universal Soldier, and the review for this film said this was his best action thriller film, so I thought why not? Basically Darren McCord (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is a disgraced firefighter, he stopped when a girl he tried to rescue died in his arms. Anyway he has moved on, has two kids, daughter Emily (Whittni Wright) and son Tyler (Ross Malinger), and has taken them to see a Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League play-off ice hockey game, unaware that upstairs the Vice President (Raymond J. Barry) and a few others are being held hostage by money hungry Joshua Foss (Powers Boothe) and his thugs. Soon enough Darren realises the situation when the bad guys start showing up and trying to kill him, and he knows he must save the V.P., as well as his daughter. Also starring Dorian Harewood as Hallmark. Van Damme is certainly better in this than the very slightly silly Universal Soldier, and it is certainly a film not just for his fans, but for all action film fans. Very good!",human,reviews

"Back in the days of Barbara Walters and Hugh Downs, 20/20 was the best news magazine show on TV. I especially liked their undercover investigations, busting scams and criminals. John F. Stossel did his ""Give Me A Break"" part very well at the time. The older 20/20 shows were the best! And I never missed a show. But ever since Hugh Downs left, the show just hasn't been the same. And now that Barbara Walters has left too, the show has become much of a joke. 20/20 used to be all about protecting the consumer and busting scams and criminals. But now, all they do on 20/20 (besides covering stories that are already all over the news, a lot of which is simply entertainment news) is bust myths. This is sadly, the exact same concept that has also brought down the Discovery Channel. The Discovery Channel used to be all about shows investigating both a lot in science and law, but now all they do is show stupid ""reality"" shows and bust urban myths. I just can't understand all of this, obviously the people in control of these TV networks today are just some really stupid (and lazy) people.",human,reviews
"I was attracted to this film because of Virginie Ledoyen (The Valet, * Women), and to a lesser extent because it was written and directed by Olivier Assayas (Boarding Gate, Demonlover, Paris, je t'aime). I was not thrilled, but I was not terribly disappointed either.Ledoyen, as were all the characters in the film was self-obsessed. Probably none more so than Gabriel (Mathieu Amalric - The Diving Bell and the Butterfly), who seemed to need a constant reaffirmation from his friends, but rejected any criticism of his aimless life.The film revolved around Adrien (François Cluzet), a writer that lived on the margins while composing novels that no one read. In fact, most all of the characters lived on the margins in meaningless jobs. They just floated instead of trying to build something.I guess if I wasn't fascinated with helping someone who seems to live a similar life, I wouldn't have found this film as interesting. But the acting rose above the story and it was, indeed a pleasure to watch.",human,reviews

"The Coen brothers flash the based on true story disclaimer for a real 1987 Minnesota incident. It's one of the misdirections. Jerry Lundegaard (William H.

Jerry is miserable working for Wade in his car dealership and he's in desperate need for cash. The kidnapping goes horribly wrong when more people get killed including a police officer. Pregnant sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) goes to investigate.This is a great movie. It has its funny moments. It has great visual touches, the quirky characters, and the off-kilter style that is the hallmark of the Coen brothers. Macy is incredible as the sniffling little weasel.

All the performances are Oscar caliber (especially Joan Allen as pat Nixon and Mary steenbergen -sic?- as Nixon's mother) and while i've never been a stone fan, i really respect the innovative film-making on this pic. he takes creative chances and ends up with a film that is really different and very watchable. i like 4th of July, JFK, natural born killers and the untouchables okay, but this is by far his best in my opinion.",human,reviews

The script is like something one would come up with friends over several too many drinks, and the production values match admirably.It's meant to be a children's movie, but features a grotesque (and poorly explained) kidnapping scene; the star dog has a lack of star quality equaled only by the other actors; and it in general has the look of being filmed in someone's backyard (the climactic soccer game features no more than three dozen extras sadly cheering in the background).It even all wraps up with a budget-ran-out voice-over sequence when the story, to one's relief, simply stops.

Much of this is complete nonsense, of course, but the alien costumes are fun in a STAR TREK way and it's nice to see where starlet Agnes Bruckner started out, a decade before THE WOODS and the like.

They include Nat King Cole's ""Stardust Memories;"" an audio excerpt from ""The Ladykillers"" -- ""Mrs. Wilberforce, I understand you have rooms to let...;"" -- and a lengthy scene consisting of an overhead tracking shot -- kids in school, church, and the cinema.

In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character, based on an actual employee of Studio from 1977 - 1982.The film's problem is that it's all glitter and style and no substance. It tries to be a really grimy and probing satire like ""Boogie Nights"" but ultimately comes across as an inferior wannabe.

Despite this slender framework, the film is rich in characterisation and incident, such as Alia's budding romance with a married man (Liu Peiqi), a narrative thread which is alternately funny and poignant, and genuinely affecting.

"First off, yes it's slow in a couple parts, and there is some goofy '90s Disney humor, however...The meat of the movie is an excellent coming of age story about taking the next step. Everyone has to let go of their childhoods, but that doesn't mean they have to forget them. This rings especially true for Charlie who has abandonment issues and feels betrayed by Bombay for not being their coach anymore.Anyone who has played peewee sports and moved on to high school or especially a private academy (like in this film) know their tricks that worked then won't work now and the gap is huge. In the end, all you have are your friends, family and teammates, and that's all that matters.Also a side note, this probably has my favorite conversation/speech in any Disney film from Gordon when he talks to Charlie about being the leader he knows he can be. Joshua Jackson carries this movie and sells the character as a confused teenager with great potential. Classic Disney film.",human,reviews

"DEATH FLASH is an independent action flick from the mid 1980s that fails to impress very much. The conception and look is heavily modelled on stunt-filled action shows from the era such as THE A-TEAM, but with poor writing and acting throughout, it's hard to enjoy this one. After an opening which feels more like some sappy family drama than anything else, we move into the usual territory where women are kidnapped and the male hero goes single-headedly up against the kidnappers. Some of the stunts are quite impressive here, given that there clearly wasn't a budget for much in the way of special effects, but with nothing to hang them on they're quite meaningless.",human,reviews

In this one, the neurasthenic Fox is an egg collector, trying to grab a couple of eggs that the Crow has gotten as a couple of war orphans. In an attempt to distract him, the Crow talks the fox into a vaudeville act -- with the usual unhappy consequences for the pair of them.The drawing style is a bit simplified for the series -- not yet at the UPA standards, but definitely trying to save a buck -- but the script is good, the gags are fun and the characters are enjoyable.",human,reviews

The other movie of the late 90's that tried to keep French audiences awake was Dobermann, which was a long nightmare exemplar of a director not knowing when to move on to the next scene. What is great about this movie's plot is that in the end, the speed racer does not resolve to firing guns or hand to hand combat which is typical of most Hollywood productions, but instead uses speed maniac mentality to outsmart the robbers.",human,reviews
"This movie was so funny. It was cheesy, yes. But it was so entertaining. There was really never a dull moment. Any critic that said the movie was bad, is so completely wrong. I would urge everyone to see this movie, you will love it. So please go see it, you will laugh till you are blue in the face. If you think you have ever been in a bad hotel with a lot of crazy people you haven't' seen anything yet. the poor bellhop in this movie went through so much and how he got through it is beyond me. this poor guy went through so much on his first night. seriously, if i ever went through this on my first day of work, i'd probably quit. I was never bored throughout the whole movie, I pretty much laughed through the whole movie. It's best when you watch it with friends,the laughter and sheer unbelievable crap they pull in this movie will just leave you in awe, and laughing a whole lot.",human,reviews
"Never having been a fan of Disney movies I was reluctant to rent this one however my wife was keen and I was somewhat reassured by the rating it had gotten on IMDB! Now I feel somewhat ripped off by my fellow IMDB-ers for misleading me so. This film is horrible and is an insult to a noble Chinese legend. Mulan as a Valley-girl!?! Mushu is nothing but a constant annoyance. The music is alternately bland and inappropriate, the dialogue incongruous, the slapstick un-funny, and the plot transparent. Now I am not a child and did not watch this with a child, but I don't think that it would have improved the experience if I had. Better avoid this one, 5/10",human,reviews
"Katnip is doing his rounds as a night watchman at ""Stacy's"" department store, when he catches Herman and his gang playing with the toys. Herman hatches a plot to get rid of Katnip by convincing the cat that he is crazy in this good episode in the cartoon series from Famous Studios.Department stores were a natural setting for comedies. Their large assortment of props and different show rooms offered a lot of choices in gags. Even though this cartoon does not offer any new jokes, it offers them capably performed and the extreme physical and facial reactions permitted by cartoons help enliven them here.",human,reviews
"I remember this as a rather odd affair, very male, not particularly woman friendly. A world where blokes are blokey and great, with lovable eccentricities, and women are for ogling - here merely disguised rather than mitigated by romantic pseudo poetic posturing. Rachel Weisz is lovely, but not a real woman, very definitely a male fantasy figure. This felt rather curious, especially when compared with An Evening With Gary Lineker, in which the characters, both male and female, were much better drawn. The attention to detail in the football seemed much better in that other play too, here it seemed rather desultory - a sequence of blokes cheering when goals went in and looking glum when they didn't. To sum up, really rather drippy, almost as wet as Morrissey's mustache as he sipped coffee by the Seine in a ludicrous, introspective setup that a teenager would have been embarrassed to have come up with. Shallow, silly, mooning, wet, not connected to the real world. Check out Lineker - it's much better.",human,reviews
"This is the film that shot Jim Carrey to super-star status in the late 90s. Until he starred in this film, he had been in ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""The Mask"" and ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" to name a few. None of them are quite as funny or entertaining as ""Liar Liar."" It's basically the story of a lawyer who lies quite often, until on his son's birthday, there is a wish made for him to not lie for one day. My, the things that occur! Carrey stars as Fletcher Reede, a defense attorney who wins his cases by having the defendants lie. His life is turned upside down however, after his son's magical wish comes true. He realizes afterward that it is family that matters most, not his work. The film sends a good message to parents about not lying to your children.",human,reviews
This is one of the scariest movie it come out before 1999. It has a great story line. It has great acting. From dusk till dawn 2 Texas blood money is scarier. Still this a very good movie. It has really good special effects. 7.3 is underrating it. I give it 9 out of 10. This is one the scariest vampire stories from 1996. See all From still dawn movies. They are great films. This is an awesome movie. I am running out thing to say. And I need more lines. I like vampires. Think vampires are so cool. This movie is awesome. Great movie great movie great movie great movie.

"Cynthia Rothrock is hot, and kicks major ass. That blunt and simple statement doesn't quite clear the way for this D-grade action film.We are talking USA Up-All Night garbage with an extra splash of violence and skin. Speaking of...we glimpse more male skin than female, which hints at a possible homo-eroticism on the director's part. Despite the eye-gouging hook finale, and Cynthia's solid moves, I still can't give this brainless film more than 1 star. For action heads, otherwise beware.The frantic nature and pace of the editing gave me recollections of Umberto Lenzi's or Nicos Mastorakis' style. This may be looking too deeply into a mud puddle, but what can I say? Certainly not a whole hell of allot more. My advice: netflix Enter the Dragon and watch something memorable.",human,reviews
"The Phantom, a man who doesn't die, a legend of the Bengali jungle. A man, who (and his ancestors and his children after him) has sworn to fight against crime his whole life.I was a fan of The Phantom comics, pretty much of the same reasons I was a fan of Tarzan when, I was a kid: They were adventurous and fun and some times thrilling or even little bit spooky. And I actually was surprised when I found out that there was a movie made out of Phantom.Now the good news: movie is set in 1938, which I thought was a good decision. There are even couple of good actors in it: Treat Williams and Catharine Zeta Jones.Bad news: Script is badly written. And actors just seem to sling out their lines without any effort to sound natural. And Treat Williams is actually pretty bad in this film. The Phantom (Billy Zane) is just badly chosen hero for this film.There are couple of good scenes in this film and sometimes even the atmosphere is great, but in over all it's actually nothing very spectacular.Easy to watch ones and forget about it after wards.",human,reviews
"I just got back from seeing Bad Boys 2 and it was the coolest move ever.  It had so much action in it topped off with comedy.  For a 2 and 1/2 hour movie it didn't seem that long at all.  I loved that it didn't have a whole lot CGI effects in it.  I liked how they actually destroyed the cars and how they really blew up that mansion, no fake model stuff.  This was just as cool as the first movie was but a little bit better and cooler.  I don't know how the critics in different areas rated the movie but the ones in my area only gave it 1 and a half stars.  I think it deserves at lease 3 and a half to 4 stars.  I can't what for this movie to hit DVD I be there to get it definitely the first day it hits shelves.  If you haven't go and see this BAD movie.",human,reviews

It's all done with it's tongue firmly in its cheek with a few one liners that I actually found quite funny. Very well made with some nice effects that wouldn't look out of place in a movie with a lot bigger budget. I would never have seen this movie if it were not for me finding it in a Bargain Bin of DVD's for less than the price of a pack of cigarettes. Glad I did and would recommend to anyone who can get a hold of it cheaply or catch it on TV. Just don't expect a classic!",human,reviews
"David Mamet is a very interesting and a very un-equal director. His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.This is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated.",human,reviews

"This movie is not for everyone; the illiterate and anyone who can't appreciate dialogue that sounds just as dead pan as it should aren't going to understand what's going on here at all. This movie takes a simple relationship, and, in a rather dead pan, witty manner, the characters go through the motions of a long term relationship in about a day. The dialogue is absolutely delicious, and the supporting characters are wonderful. The movie does a magnificent job of dissecting the personality of stereotypical people and relationships.

It's very funny at points and very scary at points. This movie delivers on both, it's exciting, it's cool, it's just plan great. I don't know what the critics say, but I think the director did a great job. I couldn't wait until they got to the queen monster, in my opinion one cool monster. Plus there is a bit of a mystery, who is the queen monster. A must see if you like alien invasion movies and if you like INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, then you'll love THE FACULTY.

Don't get me wrong - the original ""Are You Being Served?"" is hilarious. Maybe I have seen them so many times that I am tired of them. The show continues on the premise that was set up in the original series - the retirement fund into which they had all contributed during their time at Grace Brothers. The new cast members are terrific! I only wish they had made more episodes. Fleur Bennett as Mavis is delightful, and Joanne Heywood as Miss Lovelock is terrific. Billy Burden is so funny as Mavis's father, and the setting, the old manor house is beautiful. I would be happy to be a guest at their home!",human,reviews
"MANNY & LO (2 outta 5 stars)Not a bad movie... just kind of pointless after all is said and done. Two orphaned sisters (one of them pregnant) take the family car and go on the road, trying to keep from getting separated and put into foster homes. Not knowing what to do about the baby on the way, the two young girls kidnap a woman who works in a maternity goods store and hide out in a secluded cabin in the woods. Eventually the three begin to bond emotionally. This would have been a perfect example of a ""nice, family movie"" except for all the profanity spewed by the older sister. The younger sister is played by a young Scarlett Johansson... who I think was a better actress at 12 years old than she is right now. (Oh, I'm just being mean... she's not bad now either.) Mary Kay Place plays the kidnapped baby expert. Aleska Palladino (who?) plays the older sister. Pretty entertaining story... it just tends to get a bit implausible at times.",human,reviews
"Christopher Lambert (Highlander) and Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future) star in this little known comedy as Gus and Bruno two dim witted jewelry thief's who steal the wrong diamond. A comedy of errors and farce ensues as three rival groups battle for the stone.It's gentle comedy that has the occasional chuckle and is well worth a watch as the leads have a good chemistry and Christopher Lloyd gives a very good performance as the quirky older crook. Christopher Lambert shows there is more to him than Highlander and it's a shame he hasn't done more comedies. I enjoyed the film overall but it never rises above average, some of the jokes just aren't funny. But the end set up and payoff makes it worth a look.7/10 - Enjoyable but forgettable.",human,reviews
"This movie is bad. This movie is awful. I was lured in to watching it without doing any research first and was under the illusion that it may in some form be related to Francis Ford Coppola's classic, ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" It isn't. These false pretenses lead to a great deal of disappointment. But as I was watching, it occurred to me that there is one format in which this movie could be improved. That would be if Mystery Science Theater 3000 were to take on this movie as a project and were to work their magic and at least make this over-the-top, cheesy B-grade movie into something that is laughable for reasons other than the predictable dialog and ridiculously melodramatic acting. The highlight of this film comes when the mummy that the story revolves around is being depicted . The camera pans down the arm of the cloth-wrapped creature and when it focuses on the hand, one notices that something doesn't seem quite right. Apparently the special effects and make-up flunkies got together and decided to pull a prank. For some reason, this un-believable depiction of an ancient Egyptian queen has seven fingers on one hand.

"No film is a 'masterpiece' if it involved physically torturing an obviously distressed cat for 10 minutes,throwing it around like an object, before wrapping it in a net bag and hanging up, then returning with a saucer of milk which is 'supposed' to have rat poison in it, physically forcing it to drink by pressing it's head down then - in the very same shot - standing by while the cat succumbs to unconsciousness, only for the character to be seen walking around with the corpse of the same cat in the next shot.And - get this - this is not just animal cruelty. A child actor of approximately 12-13 years old performs all these acts for the camera. Christ knows what mental effect it had on her.If this film had been made by a western director, critics would be excoriating it and its director. The only thing this 'masterpiece' reveals is that hypocrisy.",human,reviews
"I love the movie Newsies! This is a great movie for the entire family, based on a historical event from the late 1800's. If you love musicals, the dance and singing numbers will definitely pull you in to this movie. My favourite songs are Carrying the Banner, Seize the Day & Santa Fe. But if you don't like musicals, this is an interesting history film too! It illustrates (in a Disneyfied way) something of what it was like to live in New York city over 100 years ago... you get some feel of how hard it was for the poor working class to survive. The topics of child labor & the treatment of orphans are touched on. My niece actually studied this musical in school! It's a good discussion starter. If you don't like history or musicals, you still might like this movie because it is also a story of a poor underdog fighting against the rich oppressor. I find SOME parts of the film slightly boring (the bits with Mr. Pulitzer drag a little), but on the whole, the movie is great. Try this movie!",human,reviews
"Woody Allen's Shadows and Fog is just play. It's a comic take on German Expressionist filmmaking, like Fritz Lang's M, and other German art, especially Kafka's The Trial. Woody Allen plays a K-like character who is woken up by a lynch mob who want his help in capturing a serial killer, but they never tell him exactly what they want him to do. Mia Farrow plays a circus sword swallower who's fed up with her husband (John Malkovich). The story is kind of random, half of it following Allen, who ends up being suspected of the murders, and the other half following Farrow, who ends up sleeping with a man (John Cusack) for the extravagant sum of $700. The story ends up being disappointing, but it's fun. It's worth a watch. 7/10.",human,reviews

Unbeknownst to them, other people are also interested in the cannon because it contains the crown jewels of England: a history professor and Abner's boss, who moonlights as a crime boss, and an British secret agent who wants to recover the jewels for England.As the other reviewer stated, ""Ernest Rides Again"" is a bit more serious in plot, but it is filled with laughs nevertheless, especially in the scenes where Varney plays against straight-man Ron James. Don't miss the hilarious canon ""chase"" scenes! The relative seriousness of the plot makes the laughs that much funnier.

All the big stars of the day were in it, and at least one 9Witherspoon) has one on to bigger and better things. At the time I was not aware that this was a remake of a 1980s film. I found it to be brilliant and quite deviously original.I now know that it is a remake, but think no less of it because of this. In many ways, this film is even more powerful.

The characters are brilliant, the timid and frail girlfriend/teacher on one hand and the scary and dominant wife/'sister' on the other. In between the husband like a ping-pong ball being played with by the two females. The movie's pace is slow but sufficiently fast to push the story forward. The turn it takes might appear kinky to some but due to the careful evolvement the story stays plausible. Taking place in one location and sticking to the three main characters the movie appears like a nice intimate play which one needs to get into it to fully enjoy.",human,reviews
"From Hell is meticulously produced and has some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in a horror movie.Although the story about who Jack the Ripper is is a little contrived at times, in general the plot is interesting. All the actors involved are excellent and the movie has the grisly moments you'd expect, considering the subject-matter. It keeps you interested and involved for the whole two hours, not to mention it looks beautiful.Heather Graham and gang as prostitutes put in a great and touching performance, showing the human side of the women that are unfortunate enough to have been in this profession in the Victorian era, and Johnny Depp is amazing, as usual, although (as others have pointed out) his English accent may be a little off, which I wouldn't know about since I'm American.This film is great entertainment and I would highly recommend buying the DVD (if you rent it you'll more than likely end up buying it anyway, it's that good).

Then Paul Thomas Anderson decided to insert this musical montage.  I had real problems with it.  To have two nearly comatose characters lip synch to a pop song blew it for me. I then saw the characters as actors acting a role.  I could suspend belief and get involved in the lives of the people portrayed before the montage but afterwards I watched craft.  The story no longer touched me.  I was just waiting for the final reel to tie up loose ends.  This movie could have been a classic.  It could have been a contender. Was the music meant to tie the characters together, to link the separate stories.  Isn't that what writing is for?  Couldn't he use a less obvious device?  That montage will look really goofy in 10 years.",human,reviews

"He's not Hollywood handsome and can't dance. He has more tenacity than brains and is more impulsive than courageous. He has a tendency to act first, think later, and screw up. He will apologize, but only if it's really necessary and not everything works out in the end for him. Such is the central character in ""The Taxman"" (Pantoliano), an okay cops vs crime flick with the twist being the hero is a federal tax investigator who stumbles into a mafia-style operation and has almost as much trouble with the system as he has with the hoodlums. ""The Taxman"" is an earnest effort and a worthwhile watch for those who are looking for a down-to-earth crime flick.",human,reviews
"I loved ""the Scarlet Dove"", a brilliant finnish film noir from 1961. And here's another brilliant finnish film noir directed the next year by Arne Taarkas, ""Hän Varasti Elämän"" with a terrific Risto Mäkelä as the crazy who kills those who discover his new life. He was not a recognized accountant, and one night, while carrying a cash payroll, he kills a lonely man and takes his identity and flee with the fortune payroll. Arriving in a village with that fortune, he becomes admired and well respected man. But fate never sleeps, the incredible never seen ending concludes a mad criminal life, but maybe ... Shot on location, all scenes are really realistic, and Risto Mälekä is impressive as the killer, some kind od Edmond O'Brien in ""the Third Voice"". And his scenes with his sexy maid are daring for that time.",human,reviews
"Sorry to say I cant agree with all the reviewers who obviously loved this film. I thought it was sentimental hokum.The retro view of 40s Mississipi just looked so staged.The situations were almost all ridiculous and it simply lacked any real emotional honesty. I had hoped that this film might be similar in feel to Hallstroms ""My Life as a Dog"" a truly original and wondrous coming of age film. Maybe I am becoming cynical as I age or maybe this movie was too Hollywood for me.So apologies to all of this movies fans ....it just didn't do it for me. As a genre there are a number of coming of age films out there to choose from.Whilst I am sure the director set out to portray an honest view of childhood there are too many other films that achieve a better and more credible vision.",human,reviews
"There's something different about ""The Hard Way"", something in its approach to a well-worn genre. Buddy cop movies were all over the place back then, and here's another one to throw on the pile. But having a pampered actor hang around a disgruntled cop offers an opportunity for Hollywood satire, which freshens up the mismatched partners angle. James Woods tends to be hit-or-miss for me, but he's ideal in such a hothead role. And wired Michael J. Fox provides a great foil. The whole thing works; the script's focused, the action's energetic and it always has that meta feel to it.7/10",human,reviews
"This is one of my favourite movies, one of the very few horror movies that don't scare me, and I prefer the ending of this over the original movie. I have the book this is based off, and this is one of the very few movies that I can watch more than once without growing bored of it. My favourite part is that David stands out the most (in a good way) among the alien children and he's my favourite character in the movie along with how he can feel empathy and he can understand people's feelings. He has a heart and he's misunderstood, but that was only because the child he was supposed to be paired with died. It's just amazing to me how it became a mixed blessing, even though the death was bad, but it's helped him out in the way that he's portrayed as a good, but misunderstood. I don't have anything negative at all to say about this movie!",human,reviews

"Even with Rob Reiner's name attached, ""The American President"" is an Aaron Sorkin movie; I don't mean just his superb dialogue, but it seems fair to say that it feels like ""The West Wing"" as a romantic comedy (i.e. right up my alley). The president's painted as an actual person, while still paying deference to the office. As political as this is, it's still a patriotic movie. The music swells at just the right moments, the ideas espoused have resonance, and you just get sucked into it.I'll be honest, with Martin Sheen in the cast, they could've gotten anyone to play the commander-in-chief and I'd still be a fan. But as Hollywood presidents go, Michael Douglas is a great one.7/10",human,reviews

"If you're looking for a fairly interesting diversion, Rush Hour should fit the bill.  The action sequences are excellent due to Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker keeps the mood comic, which is smart because this film could never be taken seriously.  Rush Hour is a good formula picture.  Put either actor alone in a movie and it wouldn't work. (I've seen other Jackie Chan movies, when he's not kickin' ass, it gets boring real quick).

"As an exercise in ""cinema du look"" Clubbed to Death is an outright tour de force of moody, atmospheric shot-making; yet its let down by its very sparse story which barely holds its 80 minute length and might as well have been written on a handkerchief. It's a pity, because the dank, underground club vibe is spot-on for the mid-1990s dance music scene. The best aspect of the film is the lighting and the dynamic choice of music, provided by such hipsters as Daft Punk and Masters at Work to namedrop but a few. In this sense, the film has limited appeal for clubheads. The acting is a bit dazed and confused which was probably the intention. This is an often intriguing attempt to tell a sparse story through dramatic visual flourishes.",human,reviews

His best friend Walter Stone (Jimmy Smits) takes a liking to Amanda.Ellen Barkin is a great dude but she's not necessarily a good comedian. This Blake Edwards comedy is not hitting exactly. I can see this work if Amanda is played by a great physical comedian. It's as if Edwards assumes that the man for woman thing would be easily funny for him once again. I also don't buy that she got Steve's job so easily. Another thing is the premise that making him a woman would automatically make it harder to get a woman to love him.

"I recently saw LIFE on tv for the first time and I must say I was impressed and most of all SURPRISED. I expected a very rude, crude kind of humor from such ""bad boy"" actors like Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence-famous for their constant foul mouthing. But LIFE was more of a comedy-drama, that had some very nice sequences, and thankfully was not filled with innuendos, and such. I do know the film has swearing, even though I saw it on tv I can always tell when they're cutting language out of a film, but it still is not as much as one would expect. If you want to have a fun night watching a good film, rent Life. Even if you're not fans of Murphy and Lawrence (which I can't say I am) you will still have a good time. It has an uplifting ending. LIFE believe it or not, is just one of those heart-warming comedy films. Enjoy! 3.5/5 stars JOHN ULMER",human,reviews
"I saw this movie accidentally on 2/22/2004 from Cinemax. Then the story of this cavalry movie really touched me. I wondered very much how the cavalry soldiers felt when they were to be replaced with mechanized units. It must be a very difficult time for them. Because I didn't remember the title of this movie after I saw it, I had tried very hard to find out more history behind this movie. For example, I found one thesis titled¡§GREASY AUTOMATONS AND THE HORSEY SET : THE U.S. CAVALRY AND MECHANIZATION, 1928-1940"", written by VINCENT J. TEDESCO III for his Master Degree at THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, THE GRADUATE SCHOOL, COLLEGE OF THE LIBERAL ARTS in May 1995. I tried to study if this movie story was real. Eventually I searched IMDb today and got some information about this movie. I feel very happy that IMDb provides such useful data of all movies.

Nothing about the story is new or innovative but some good actors and entertaining fight scenes save the movie.  Aaliyah is a very natural actress and her chemistry with Jet Li is just right.  Li demonstrates that he is an incredibly skilled martial artist and has charming wit and style.  I look forward to seeing more of his work.  The supporting performances are good all around, especially from veteran actor, Delroy Lindo.  The one problem I had with the movie was that the fight scenes depended too much on special effects when Li's talent on display should have been enough.  I did however enjoy watching a bone chilling special effect that is used to show the core of combatants before their ultimate demise.  Overall, I give it an 8/10.",human,reviews
"On the surface, Porco Rosso (1992) is a lushly animated adventure flick with a tinge of nostalgia for the pilots of the 1920s. Underneath the skin, its a film fraught with anxiety about war and fascism. In some ways, it is like Miyazaki's first feature, The Castle of Cagliostro (1979), a seemingly frothy popcorn film that contains well-hidden sadness at the core; however, here that sadness is much more visible.This seems to be one of Miyazaki's lesser known films for whatever reason. Is it because the main character is a middle aged man disillusioned with life instead of a child or teenager? Is it the pre-WWII setting? Is it the lack of fantasy elements (outside of the protagonist having turned himself into a pig, that is)? I don't know, but it's a shame.",human,reviews
"This is the type of film that you can just sit back and enjoy. The male leads(Diggs, Epps and Jones) have chemistry as well as their young counterparts. The plot is simple and easy to follow. Roland(Diggs) is about to get married, but chickens out and goes over an old girlfriends house instead.Then Mike(Epps) and Slim(Jones) are sent over there to go get him before the wedding. While getting him sobered up, Mike reminisced on when they first met. This movie is better than movies of the same theme(The Best Man, The Brothers, etc.) because the male leads are more likable and less one dimensional, although Rolands reasons for not wanting to get married aren't explained enough. Also, the girl that plays young Alicia is way too old for the role.Bottom line, the narrative by Epps is good and it's not riddled with stereotypes. Also, the 80's soundtrack is great and this is an entertaining movie. 7/10",human,reviews
"This movie was good all around...acting, casting, script, etc. It intertwined comedy and drama without missing a beat, while dealing with a very ""taboo"" subject in our society. I have seen a few other movies that focused on gay relationships but they didn't seem real to me. They seemed to focus on either the stereotypical lifestyle, on portraying them as victims of society, or were over-dramatized. Watching ""Jeffrey"" allowed me to feel the emotions of the characters and get pulled into their lives and issues and feel their highs and lows right along with them. The characters were going through everyday emotional relationship ordeals that I could relate to as a heterosexual as well as some specific issues that homosexuals face. I highly recommend this movie...it is interesting and different. SPOILER AHEAD! SPOILER AHEAD!--->I've never seen a movie before where I was passionately rooting for two men to get together and kiss.

"Donald Duck has always been one of my favourites, which is reason enough to see The New Spirit. The message is interesting for the time, but feels dated I agree by today's standards. But other than that, there is very little to criticise. The animation is wonderful with lots of colour and detail, the war-like images are almost harrowing while the music is lush and catchy. The New Spirit has some fine moments like the ending and particularly the almost surreal part where the writing accessories come to life, and while things get more serious after a subtly humorous start it gets its point across without feeling too heavy-handed. Donald is strongly characterised, with his fever-pitch enthusiasm steadily wavering, and comes across as a very relevant spokesperson.All in all, well made and fascinating if with a dated message. 8/10 Bethany Cox",human,reviews
"The film is very unique, not only in sometimes the way it was filmed and the musical score that accompanies it, but the whole story's focus and time period are very unique. I felt as if the film was truly interesting because of the aforementioned, and thus something that was very gripping in its' own way. There is constantly breaths of fresh air blown into the plot of the film, making sure that each scene leaves you anticipating the next.I always liked this film because of the fact that you cannot exactly put your finger on it, and you are never quite sure what, exactly, is going on and where the film is going -- it is the sort of film that from time to time I think back to, thinking of all of the unique characteristics that went into it; all of the unique aspects that makme it stand out.

I really felt sorry for this cheerful, shy and friendly girl who couldn't manage to get a decent social relationship in this new environment.

"Once again, the animals and their corresponding voices from famous actors make up the bulk of the film (as opposed to real-life actors Robert Hays and Kim Griest playing actual people). Also, we have a similar theme as in the first ""Homeward Bound"" with animals lost and having to find their way home. This sequel is not as good as the original. It dwells a little too much on the romance between the two dogs, and it doesn't show enough interesting scenes in San Francisco, which you would really expect from the title of the film alone. The animals stayed too long in one spot and should have been on the move more.Otherwise, Michael J. Fox and Sally Field once again have a ton of gag lines to speak as the dog and cat, respectively. Many of their lines were good, some very clever that kids won't understand. The jokes of those two were the highlight of the movie. There were no annoying or evil villains, or even bad-guy dog catchers.All in all, it was okay but nothing special.",human,reviews
"“Dinner Guest” is a single by British rapper and singer AJ Tracey, featuring fellow UK rapper MoStack. The track arrived on 29 April 2020 and later served as the lead single for AJ Tracey’s second studio album, *Flu Game*, which was released in 2021. In the UK, the song became one of Tracey’s bigger chart hits of the period, reaching the top five on the UK Singles Chart and remaining a consistent presence in the upper end of the rankings for several weeks.

A notable musical element of “Dinner Guest” is its use of an interpolation and sample connected to “Push the Feeling On” by Scottish house act Nightcrawlers. That recognisable melody underpins the chorus and ties the song’s rap verses to a dance-oriented hook, a crossover approach frequently heard in UK rap and pop-rap releases around that time. The sample also appeared in other contemporary tracks, reflecting how older club records are often recycled to create familiar, crowd-friendly refrains.

The song was written and put together in early 2020, with AJ Tracey involved in the creative direction and production alongside The Elements. Its release also intersected with the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. In response to the developing public health crisis, Tracey stated that proceeds from first-week downloads would be donated to the COVID-19 Urgent Appeal to help support NHS workers and volunteers. The announcement followed his participation in the BBC Radio 1 charity cover “Times Like These,” another high-profile fundraising effort that reached number one.

On the charts, “Dinner Guest” entered the UK top ten in its opening week and held positions around the lower end of the top ten before climbing higher, eventually hitting its peak at number five in late June 2020.",ai,informative
"The 2013 local elections in New Zealand were the nationwide round of votes held every three years to choose representatives for local government. Voters selected mayors, councillors, and community board members, and also elected people to serve on District Health Boards and certain other local organisations such as Licensing Trusts. Voting was carried out by mail, with the official election day falling on Saturday 12 October 2013.

Most councils used the first-past-the-post method, where the candidates with the highest totals win the available positions. A smaller number of councils used the single transferable vote system, which allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference and can produce more proportional outcomes. In 2013, STV was used by the city and district councils in Dunedin, Kapiti Coast, Marlborough, Palmerston North, Porirua, and Wellington. Among regional councils, the Wellington Regional Council was the only one to apply STV. District Health Board elections, by contrast, were conducted using STV across the country.

Not every area held elections that year. Environment Canterbury and Kaipara District were being run under statutory management arrangements, so the usual local authority elections did not take place there.

The timing of the elections was set by legislation. The Local Electoral Act 2001 requires a general election for members of local authorities and community boards on the second Saturday of October every third year, which set the date in 2013. The Electoral Commission published a schedule of key steps leading up to polling, including nomination periods and the mailing and return of ballot papers.

There was discussion about whether other votes might be held alongside the local elections, but a separate referendum was ultimately conducted later in the year using its own postal voting period.",ai,informative
"*Bahamut* is the first full-length release by the American ensemble Hazmat Modine, a group known for blending blues and folk traditions with jazz and global influences. Issued on August 26, 2006 through Barbès Records, the album presents a mix of original compositions and reworked traditional material. Much of the writing comes from the band’s frontman, Wade Schuman, while several pieces draw on older songs that the group reshapes through distinctive arrangements and an unusual instrumental palette.

A notable feature of the record is the participation of the Tuvan group Huun-Huur-Tu on three selections. Their signature throat-singing adds a resonant, overtone-rich vocal texture that contrasts with and complements Hazmat Modine’s roots-based sound. The overall instrumentation is intentionally eclectic, incorporating brass and reeds alongside multiple guitars and less common instruments such as claviola and cimbalom. This combination allows the band to move between grooves and timbres associated with blues, klezmer, calypso, ska, and other styles without settling into a single genre identity.

The album achieved measurable commercial visibility within its niche, reaching number 12 on Billboard’s Top Blues Albums chart. Critical response was generally positive. AllMusic’s Jeff Tamarkin awarded it four out of five stars, emphasizing the group’s ability to merge disparate traditions into music that feels both familiar and unconventional. Pitchfork’s Joe Tangari also highlighted the collaboration “Everybody Loves You,” describing the project as an expansive, “roots” approach that remains striking in its final result.",ai,informative
"Daniel “Dan” K. McAllister (born May 14, 1965 in Iqaluit, Nunavut) is a former territorial legislator and onetime operations supervisor in the northern retail sector. He entered public office after winning the 2005 territorial election in the Qikiqtaaluk South district, unseating a sitting representative in a close contest. During his first term, he sat on committees dealing with community services and government spending, and he was known locally for emphasizing practical improvements to housing and transportation.

Near the end of his mandate, McAllister became the subject of an ethics review related to residency and public allowances. In 2008, the territory’s integrity commissioner found that he had signed a declaration stating that his primary residence was in a smaller community within his district. That declaration made him eligible for a living allowance intended to cover the additional cost of maintaining accommodations in the capital while the assembly was in session. Investigators later concluded that he spent most of his time at an address in the capital and did not meet the residency standard required for the benefit. The ruling ordered repayment of a portion of the allowance and prompted stricter guidance on documentation for future claims.

McAllister ran again in the next general election but placed near the bottom of the results and did not return to the legislature.",ai,informative
"Phoenix is the fifth studio release by the American vocal group Labelle, issued in 1975. While it did not become a major crossover blockbuster, it performed respectably, reaching the mid-range of the main pop album chart and landing in the top tier of the R&B listings. Promotion for the record produced a small-charting single, “Messin’ with My Mind,” authored by group member Nona Hendryx, who served as the album’s primary songwriter.

The record stands out in the trio’s catalog because it shifts stylistic emphasis compared with the funk-driven direction of the previous year’s Nightbirds. Phoenix leans more heavily into rock textures, using sharper guitar lines and a more aggressive band sound, while still retaining the group’s layered harmonies and soul phrasing. Several song titles and lyrical themes draw on celestial imagery, suggesting a loose concept built around transformation and motion.

Most of the tracks were composed by Hendryx, with selected pieces credited to additional writers. The album’s sequence includes “Phoenix (The Amazing Flight of a Lone Star),” “Slow Burn,” “Black Holes in the Sky,” “Good Intentions,” and the co-written “Far As We Felt Like Goin’.” The second half features “Messin’ with My Mind,” “Chances Go Round,” “Cosmic Dancer,” “Take the Night Off,” and “Action Time,” illustrating a mix of concise songs and longer, more exploratory arrangements.

Labelle’s core lineup—Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendryx, and Sarah Dash—handles the lead and group vocals. The backing musicians include guitars, bass, keyboards, drums, and percussion, augmented by a horn section and additional instrumental colors such as organ and electric piano. Production and arranging work helped connect the rock-leaning approach with the group’s established R&B foundations, making Phoenix a transitional project that documents Labelle experimenting with a broader sonic palette.",ai,informative
"Rolf Ketterman (born 12 March 1962) is a retired Dutch cyclist who later worked as a team sporting director. He is best known for his achievements in cyclo-cross, including winning the men’s title at the 1990 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships. Cycling was a family interest: his younger brother, Pieter, also raced at elite level for several seasons.

Ketterman grew up in a small town near Nijmegen and began his career on the road, where he developed endurance and bike-handling skills on narrow, winding courses. Although he collected a handful of notable results in one-day races, he gradually shifted his attention to cyclo-cross after finishing on the podium at the 1988 World Championships. That performance convinced him that the winter discipline suited him better, and he spent extended periods racing in Belgium and northern France, where the sport had the deepest fields and the most frequent events.

His breakthrough came at the 1990 Worlds, held on a demanding circuit featuring heavy grass sections, deep ruts, and a steep bank that riders had to crest repeatedly. Ketterman’s advantage was his ability to stay mounted longer than most competitors and accelerate immediately after the technical sections. By gaining a few seconds each lap at the same key obstacles, he built a decisive lead and secured the rainbow jersey.

After his world title, Ketterman became a regular contender in major series events and helped draw attention to cyclo-cross in the Netherlands, where the sport was still developing compared with Belgium. His later career was marked by occasional disputes around equipment rules and race incidents, though he avoided lengthy suspensions and continued competing at a high level through the early 1990s.

Following retirement, he moved into management, serving as a directeur sportif for several professional teams and guiding younger riders through the tactical and logistical demands of the cyclo-cross season.",ai,informative
"Mezek is a small settlement in southeastern Bulgaria within the municipality of Svilengrad, Haskovo Province. The village is positioned where the eastern Rhodope foothills meet the lowlands, close to the national border with Greece and within easy reach of the Bulgarian–Turkish frontier. Because of this location, the area has long been influenced by trade routes and shifting political boundaries, which is reflected in the range of historical sites found nearby.

The best-known landmark is the medieval fortress above the village, often cited as one of the most intact defensive complexes from Bulgaria’s Middle Ages. Most scholars date its construction to the 11th century, when border fortifications were important for controlling passes and roads. The fortification is notable for its multiple towers and a layout designed to reinforce the most exposed sections of the walls. Built primarily from stone, its exterior includes decorative brick bands that add both strength and a distinct appearance. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, parts of the structure were damaged when building material was taken from the ruins for other construction projects in the region.

Mezek is also associated with Thracian heritage through two beehive-style tombs in the vicinity. The larger tomb, dated to the 4th century BCE, consists of a long covered entrance corridor leading to successive chambers and a circular burial room containing a stone sarcophagus. Archaeological research has indicated multiple high-status burials, and many recovered objects—metal ornaments, vessels, and other grave goods—are preserved in national museum collections.

Beyond archaeology, the village is recognized for local wine production, with vineyards benefiting from the warm borderland climate. For visitors interested in nature, a marked hiking route begins in the village and climbs toward nearby peaks, offering a longer walk suitable for a full-day outing.",ai,informative
"Eulace Peacock (August 27, 1914 – December 13, 1996) was a prominent American track and field competitor whose best years came during the 1930s, a period when U.S. sprinting and jumping events drew growing national attention. He was born in Dothan, Alabama, and as a child moved to New Jersey, where he grew up in the Vauxhall area of Union Township. At Union High School he developed into an unusually versatile athlete, showing speed in short sprints as well as ability in the long jump. In 1933 he produced a record-setting jump that became one of the most durable marks in New Jersey scholastic history, remaining unmatched for decades. The same era also brought frequent comparisons to Jesse Owens, and the two met often in high-profile meets, creating a rivalry that helped elevate interest in amateur track.

After high school, Peacock enrolled at Temple University in Philadelphia. While in college he continued to compete at an elite level and joined Alpha Phi Alpha, reflecting both his athletic and campus involvement. He became especially known for his success in multi-event competition. Over the course of his career he won the Amateur Athletic Union outdoor pentathlon title six times, with victories spanning the mid-1930s and extending into the World War II years. His combination of sprinting speed and jumping skill made him dangerous in meets that rewarded all-around performance, and he occasionally defeated Owens in head-to-head races. A notable win in 1935 received wide coverage and reinforced the view that Peacock was among the strongest contenders in American track.

His trajectory toward the 1936 Olympic season was disrupted by injury. A hamstring problem prevented him from reaching the form needed to qualify for the Berlin Games, an outcome often cited as one of the major “what ifs” of that Olympic cycle. During the war years he served in the United States Coast Guard, and after his athletic prime he pursued business, including operating a liquor store and later a car-rental venture.

Peacock remained connected to the sport by working as an official at major meets, including national championships and Olympic trials. Over time, athletic organizations recognized his achievements, including induction into track and field halls of fame. He died in Yonkers, New York, at age 82 after living with Alzheimer’s disease, and was buried at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla.",ai,informative
"Agnes “Nan” Paterson Hardie (5 October 1885 – 27 June 1947) was a Scottish activist associated with the labour movement and local government in Ayrshire. Born in the mining town of Cumnock, she grew up in a household where politics and working-class organisation were regular topics of conversation. Her father, Keir Hardie, was an influential trade union figure who later became a leading voice in the early Labour Party. He encouraged his daughter’s interest in public affairs, exposed her to debates within the movement, and helped her meet prominent reformers and organisers. These early contacts shaped her outlook and provided a network that remained important throughout her life.

Hardie’s formal education ended when she was fourteen, a common experience in working communities at the time. In her late teens she suffered a severe period of illness, including pleurisy and appendicitis. Although she recovered, her health remained fragile, affecting her stamina while not diminishing her commitment to public work. During the years before the First World War she often travelled with her father as he addressed meetings, including a trip to Nova Scotia in 1912. When his health deteriorated in 1915, she and her mother became his principal carers until his death later that year.

In 1924 she married Emrys Hughes, a socialist journalist and political organiser. For much of the following decade she supported his work, assisting with campaigns, correspondence, and local engagement. Her own public role expanded in 1933 when she won election to Cumnock Town Council. There she became closely involved with municipal services, notably through leadership in public health, where housing conditions and sanitation were central concerns.

By the mid-1930s she held the civic office of provost, and she and her husband pursued an ambitious programme to replace overcrowded and unhealthy housing with municipally built homes. The initiative transformed living conditions on a large scale and became a defining feature of the town’s interwar development. Alongside housing, she promoted recreation and welfare, with particular attention to opportunities for children, and encouraged accessible outdoor pursuits such as cycling.

Hardie also served as a magistrate and, during the Second World War, chaired a local war work organisation aimed at supporting service personnel and their families. Even while holding critical views about the conflict, she emphasised practical assistance and community welfare. In 1946 Hughes fell seriously ill, and the strain of caring responsibilities worsened her own condition. She died in June 1947.",ai,informative
"Ion Grigorescu (12 February 1875 – 6 May 1946) was a Romanian scientist and public figure known for his work in chemistry and higher education. He became a full member of the Romanian Academy in the mid-1920s, recognition that reflected his influence on scientific training in the country. Grigorescu was born in a rural community near Iași, into a family shaped by local administration; his father, a village official, died when Ion was still a child, a loss that affected his early years but did not interrupt his studies.

After completing secondary school, he pursued university training in Romania and continued specialization abroad, returning with a strong interest in the emerging field of physical chemistry. At the University of Iași he taught for decades, introducing laboratory-based instruction and encouraging students to connect chemical theory with measurable phenomena. He is often associated with the publication of one of the earliest Romanian-language courses that systematically treated kinetic theory, thermodynamics, electrochemistry, and atomic structure.

Alongside academic work, Grigorescu participated in civic life and joined a major agrarian political movement of the interwar period. He later held municipal responsibilities in Iași, where he promoted public education and support for cultural institutions. His family life was extensive, and several descendants pursued careers in scholarship and the arts.",ai,informative
"A clearance measuring vehicle is a specialized piece of railroad maintenance equipment used to verify the free space around a track. Railways must ensure that bridges, tunnels, platforms, signals, and other trackside structures leave enough room for trains that match the company’s approved loading limits. This safe space is often described as the route’s “clearance envelope,” accounting not only for a car’s static dimensions but also for sway, suspension movement, and track curvature.

By recording real-world clearances along a corridor, the railway can confirm that standard freight and passenger equipment can pass without contact. The same data is also valuable when planning shipments that exceed typical dimensions, such as transformers or industrial machinery. With accurate measurements, operators can judge whether an oversized load can travel a given route and identify the maximum practical height or width.

Early systems were relatively simple. Some railroads mounted a rigid frame shaped to the permitted profile on a flatcar; any strike against an obstruction indicated that the route no longer met requirements. More advanced designs introduced flexible “feelers” or whisker-like rods extending outward. When a rod brushed a structure, its movement could be recorded and translated into a clearance reading. Because the rods could bend and spring back, they reduced damage during minor contacts.

Modern clearance surveys increasingly rely on optical sensors. Laser scanners and other electronic instruments can map the surrounding space continuously while the vehicle moves, producing detailed digital profiles. These systems are often installed on self-propelled units, including road-rail vehicles that can operate both on highways and on tracks. The resulting measurements support safer operations, faster route qualification, and more confident planning for nonstandard shipments.",ai,informative
"Riverside Park North is a neighbourhood green space in Ottawa, situated near the residential streets off Harkness Avenue. The park commemorates Pauline Vanier, a well-known community figure, and reflects the city’s postwar expansion of local recreation areas. It was created in the early 1960s on land that had previously been used for farming, and it sits close to a nearby public school, which has helped make it a common destination for families.

For many years, residents associated the park with seasonal community events. A long-running fireworks night was coordinated by the local community and recreation association and became a yearly tradition. Over time, updated safety rules and the need for more space led organizers to relocate the event to a larger venue. After several years without a display, the fireworks returned to the broader area when celebrations were later hosted at Mooney’s Bay.

The park includes standard amenities for children, such as swings and climbing equipment, along with an outdoor wading pool used during the summer. The City of Ottawa is responsible for operating the pool, providing supervision during open hours, and managing daily maintenance. The pool area is not enclosed; it is typically filled for daytime use and emptied at the end of the day.

A small field house supports park operations, serving as a staff base and storage space. Built as part of a citywide program in the late 1960s, it also becomes useful in winter when a boarded outdoor skating rink is set up nearby. Community volunteers help maintain the ice through the season. Baseball and t-ball diamonds round out the park’s sports facilities.",ai,informative
"Tiffany D. Cross (born February 6, 1979) is an American journalist, television host, political commentator, and author. She is known for presenting MSNBC’s Saturday morning program *The Cross Connection*, where she discusses national politics and current events with a focus on culture, policy, and civic participation.

Cross was born in Ohio and spent much of her upbringing moving between Cleveland and Atlanta, experiences that later shaped her interest in how regional communities engage with news and public life. As a teenager, she became interested in television journalism and imagined a career that combined sharp political reporting with a strong on-air presence. She later enrolled at Clark Atlanta University, studying mass communications with coursework centered on broadcasting, including radio, television, and film.

Her career began in radio news in Atlanta, where she worked as a reporter and gained experience covering local stories and interviewing public figures. She later moved into television production and held positions at major media organizations, including work with CNN as an associate producer during the 2000s. Cross also took on leadership responsibilities as bureau chief in Washington, D.C. for BET Networks, a role that involved managing political coverage from the nation’s capital and coordinating reporting around elections and federal policy.

Alongside newsroom roles, Cross expanded her work into public speaking and analysis. She became affiliated with the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics as a resident fellow, engaging with students and public forums on media, democracy, and political participation. She also appeared frequently on MSNBC programs, including *AM Joy*, where she provided commentary on breaking news and the political landscape.

In 2020, Cross published *Say It Louder: Black Voters, Our Voices, and the Shaping of American Democracy*, a book that examines the influence of Black voters in U.S. elections and the broader struggle for representation. Later that year, MSNBC selected her to lead a new weekend show, marking a significant step in her on-air hosting career and expanding her role within the network’s political programming.",ai,informative
"The system of ranks and insignia used by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the years after the Soviet Union’s collapse developed through a series of regulatory and design adjustments. When the Russian state inherited much of the former Soviet military structure, it also inherited an established visual language for identifying service branch, category of personnel, and seniority. Over time, that legacy was revised to reflect new legal frameworks, new uniforms, and a desire to standardize markings across the services.

One important shift concerned the highest grades. The post-Soviet regulations removed several Soviet-era senior marshal titles that had once existed for particular branches. As a result, the top of the hierarchy was simplified, leaving a smaller set of apex appointments and clearer distinctions between general and flag officers.

Rank insignia in this period relied heavily on shoulder boards, which served as the primary display area for symbols, stripes, and stars. The details varied by uniform type. Working and field uniforms tended to use subdued or simplified shoulder boards suited to camouflage and daily wear, while service and parade uniforms used brighter colors and more decorative elements, making rank and affiliation easy to recognize at formal events.

Enlisted personnel generally had minimal rank display on everyday clothing. On some uniforms, the shoulder board could carry a letter or emblem indicating affiliation rather than a detailed rank. Such markings helped distinguish broad categories—such as armed forces or naval personnel—and also identified students in military educational institutions. Cadets and school pupils could be marked by letters associated with their academy or training track, while naval trainees might use an anchor motif rather than a letter.

Non-commissioned officers used more explicit rank cues. Their shoulder boards combined branch identifiers with stripes that indicated progression through NCO grades. Color and finish depended on the uniform: field gear used muted tones, whereas service and ceremonial uniforms used brighter or metallic-looking trim. This made it possible to preserve readability without compromising practical considerations in the field.

Warrant officers and their naval equivalents occupied an intermediate category. Their shoulder boards often resembled those of enlisted and NCO personnel in overall shape and branch marking, but rank was shown by small stars set in a vertical pattern. This star arrangement provided a clear visual separation from both stripe-based NCO insignia and the larger star systems used for commissioned officers.

For commissioned officers, star size and the presence of decorative borders signaled status and level of command. Junior officers typically used simpler boards with basic ornamentation and smaller metal stars. Field-grade and staff officers used more elaborate layouts, including additional vertical elements and larger stars. The most senior appointments used richer embroidery, with prominent stars and, at the very top, state symbols such as the Russian coat of arms.

These conventions were later superseded by updated standards introduced by presidential decree in 2010, following a transition period that began with new uniform issues in the late 2000s. The result was a revised, legally defined insignia system intended to modernize appearance while maintaining continuity in how rank and role are displayed.",ai,informative
"Castillo de San José is a coastal fortress in Arrecife, the capital of Lanzarote in Spain’s Canary Islands, and it is now best known for housing a museum devoted to modern and contemporary art. The building combines military architecture from the late eighteenth century with a later cultural role that reflects the island’s efforts to preserve heritage while expanding public access to the arts.

Construction took place between 1776 and 1779, during a period of severe hardship on Lanzarote. The island had suffered long-term damage from the Timanfaya volcanic eruptions earlier in the century, and repeated droughts further reduced agricultural output. In response to poverty and food shortages, the Spanish crown supported public works that could provide wages as well as infrastructure. The fortress therefore served two purposes: it offered employment to residents in crisis, and it strengthened defenses against maritime threats, including pirate raids that had been a recurring concern for Atlantic islands.

The fort occupies a strategic position above the Puerto de Naos area, looking out across the sea approaches to Arrecife. Its plan is adapted to coastal defense, with rounded seaward-facing walls designed to better withstand cannon fire and to widen the field of view. The landward side was more controlled, incorporating additional protective elements and a restricted entrance. Built from local stone, including volcanic materials, the structure contains a series of vaulted interior spaces that were suited to storage and military use, such as keeping supplies and ammunition under stable conditions.

In the second half of the twentieth century, the site underwent a major transformation. Rather than remaining a purely historic monument, it was refurbished to become an arts venue, with design interventions led by the Lanzarote-born artist and architect César Manrique. The museum that opened in the 1970s became known as the International Museum of Contemporary Art (MIAC). Its collection emphasizes art from the postwar decades, particularly works associated with abstraction and experimentation, including sculpture, kinetic pieces, and geometric or informal abstract painting. Spanish artists are especially prominent, and the museum also highlights creators connected to the Canary Islands.

The fort’s courtyard and surrounding areas are used for displaying works in open air, linking the art to the landscape and the building’s distinctive silhouette. An additional renovation created a restaurant within an adjoining section, connected internally and designed to take advantage of the sweeping views over the harbor, making the site both a cultural destination and a prominent landmark on Lanzarote’s coastline.",ai,informative
"Monument Park is the outdoor walkway beyond center field at Yankee Stadium, the home of the New York Yankees. It functions as both a passageway for fans and a public tribute to the players, managers, and executives who shaped the franchise. Although it sits within a modern ballpark, the idea behind the space is rooted in an older tradition: the Yankees long maintained a dedicated area for plaques and retired numbers, treating the stadium itself as a museum of team history.

The park is arranged as a landscaped exhibit that can be viewed from the concourse. Along the perimeter are bronze plaques that summarize achievements and highlight key moments. Nearby, a row of large numbers marks the jerseys that the organization has taken out of circulation in honor of iconic figures. Together, the plaques and numbers help explain why certain names carry special weight, even for visitors who may not know the details of different eras of baseball.

Several monuments stand out for their scale and prominence, often dedicated to legendary Yankees such as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Joe DiMaggio. These pieces are not simply decorative; they represent how baseball teams preserve collective memory in a way that resembles civic memorials. The names and dates provide an accessible timeline, while the surrounding design encourages fans to pause and read rather than simply pass by on the way to their seats.

Because the area is visible to the public, it also shapes the pregame routine. Fans frequently gather along the railings to take photos, point out familiar numbers, or compare the careers of different honorees. In this sense, Monument Park plays a role similar to a small exhibit hall: it offers context for what is happening on the field by emphasizing the continuity between past and present.

The location near center field is practical as well. It makes the tribute space easy to reach from multiple gates and places it close to concessions and other fan amenities. The result is a setting where history and entertainment sit side by side, reinforcing the idea that a baseball game is not only a competition, but also part of an ongoing story that the stadium is designed to tell.",ai,informative
"Arba Minch Airport serves the city of Arba Minch in southern Ethiopia, within the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region. The city’s name is sometimes written in different Latin spellings, and the airport is commonly referred to by those variants as well. The airfield lies a short distance from the urban centre, positioned near the lakes that characterize the area, including Lake Abaya, making it an important access point for residents, officials, and visitors traveling to the Rift Valley region.

The airport is built on elevated terrain, which influences aircraft performance and operational planning. It has a single paved runway identified by the numbers 03 and 21, indicating its approximate compass headings. The runway surface is asphalt-based, suitable for regular domestic operations using small and medium-sized aircraft. Basic aviation infrastructure supports routine passenger handling and airfield services, allowing scheduled flights to connect Arba Minch with larger hubs in Ethiopia. As with many regional airports, the range of destinations can change depending on airline schedules, seasonal demand, and broader network planning.

Beyond civilian transport, the airport has also drawn attention for security-related activity. In the early 2010s, public reporting indicated that U.S. forces were using the location to support surveillance missions in the Horn of Africa, including reconnaissance flights associated with monitoring militant groups in Somalia. Statements attributed to U.S. military representatives described a limited footprint focused on operational and technical assistance, and emphasized cooperation dependent on approval from Ethiopian authorities. Reports also noted that investments were made to improve facilities for unmanned aircraft operations, while suggesting that missions were oriented toward intelligence collection rather than launching strikes from the airfield. Over time, the regional basing and deployment arrangements for such systems have shifted, with some related sites elsewhere being scaled down or closed.",ai,informative
"Kolkata TV is a round-the-clock Bengali-language news broadcaster that began operations in 2006 under the umbrella of SST Media. The channel’s early formation is associated with journalist Suman Chattopadhyay, who had earlier worked with ABP and played a key role in shaping the station’s initial direction. Over time, the network came under the control of Kaustuv Ray, who is linked to the RP Group and has also served as the channel’s editor. Its on-air tagline, “Raatdin Saatdin,” conveys the idea of continuous news coverage throughout the week.

The channel is operated by RP Techvision (I) Pvt Ltd, based in Kolkata. In the public sphere, Kolkata TV has often been identified with an editorial posture that scrutinizes the Narendra Modi-led central government while appearing comparatively accommodating toward the Trinamool Congress (TMC), a major political force in West Bengal. Such perceptions have contributed to the channel’s distinct positioning within the state’s competitive regional media environment.

Kolkata TV and its owner have also drawn attention due to a series of legal and regulatory developments. Kaustuv Ray has faced investigative actions by central agencies, including Enforcement Directorate (ED) searches reported in 2018. He was later arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection with allegations related to bank fraud involving substantial sums. Reports also mention that he received further ED communication in 2021.

Around the same period, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting issued a formal notice to the channel asking why its broadcasting authorization should not be withdrawn. The communication cited the Ministry of Home Affairs’ decision regarding security clearance as the basis for potential cancellation. Ray publicly argued that the measure was intended to curb critical journalism and intimidate outlets that challenge those in power.

The episode triggered political debate and drew statements of support for the channel from several opposition parties and prominent figures, including leaders from West Bengal and other states. In subsequent court proceedings, interim legal protections were reported, including directions limiting coercive action and judicial scrutiny of the government’s notice.",ai,informative
"The 2021 Nottingham Trophy was a professional tennis event held on outdoor grass courts in Nottingham, United Kingdom. It formed part of two competitive circuits: the men’s tournament belonged to the ATP Challenger Tour, while the women’s tournament was included on the ITF Women’s World Tennis Tour. Matches were played over one week from 14 to 20 June 2021, serving as a lead-up opportunity for players preparing for the grass-court season.

As in most tournaments, the singles draws were built from several entry categories. Seeded players were determined by their world rankings from late May 2021. In addition to direct acceptances, a number of competitors entered through wildcards, which are invitations granted by the organizers, often to support local players or promising young athletes. On the men’s side, wildcards were given to Jay Clarke, Anton Matusevich, and Aidan McHugh. One player, Tomáš Macháč, was admitted using a protected ranking, a mechanism that helps athletes return to competition after a long injury absence.

Other places in the men’s main draw were filled by alternates, including Thomas Fabbiano, Leonardo Mayer, and Go Soeda. Several players advanced through qualifying, such as Alex Bolt, Marius Copil, Ernesto Escobedo, and Ramkumar Ramanathan, while Zhang Zhizhen entered as a lucky loser after a withdrawal.

The women’s draw also featured wildcards, awarded to Jodie Burrage, Samantha Murray Sharan, Matilda Mutavdzic, and Emma Raducanu. Qualifiers included Cristina Bucșa, Mayo Hibi, Monica Niculescu, Arina Rodionova, Storm Sanders, and Daria Snigur.

In the finals, Alex Bolt won the men’s singles title, and Alison Van Uytvanck claimed the women’s singles championship. The doubles trophies went to Marc Polmans and Matt Reid in the men’s event, and to Monica Niculescu and Elena-Gabriela Ruse in the women’s competition.",ai,informative
"Shaba Hills Wildlife Reserve is a protected conservation area in northern Kenya, within Isiolo County. It was first set aside in the mid‑20th century as part of a broader network of game areas intended to safeguard wildlife and water sources in the arid north. Over time, its limits and management arrangements were refined, and today the reserve is overseen by local authorities in cooperation with national conservation bodies and nearby communities. Because it lies on a well-known safari circuit, several lodges and tented camps operate in and around the reserve, offering guided drives and nature walks.

Geographically, Shaba Hills lies close to other protected lands along the Ewaso Ng’iro River system, which acts as a natural corridor for wildlife moving between seasonal grazing and permanent water. The terrain is shaped by ancient volcanic activity: dark basalt outcrops, weathered lava terraces, and open plains that gently rise into low rocky ridges. These landforms influence drainage, creating pockets where groundwater reaches the surface as springs or seepage areas. The climate is characteristically hot and semi‑arid, with irregular rainfall and long dry periods that make access to reliable water especially important for both animals and people.

Vegetation varies with soil and moisture. Along riverbanks and seasonal channels, denser woodland can form, with tall acacias and palms providing shade and nesting sites. Away from water, drought-tolerant bushland dominates, including thorny shrubs and resinous species such as Commiphora. On exposed lava, plant cover becomes sparse, while occasional alkaline flats support tough grasses that green up quickly after rains. Succulents and flowering shrubs appear in scattered patches, adding brief bursts of color during favorable seasons. Some trees are valued locally for practical uses, such as chewing sticks for dental care and browse for livestock.

The reserve supports a wide range of wildlife adapted to dry landscapes. Zebras, giraffes, elephants, and antelope species such as gerenuk and oryx are common sights, while predators including lion, leopard, and cheetah follow the distribution of prey. Birds are especially diverse, from raptors riding thermals above the plains to waterbirds concentrated at pools. In the riverine sections, crocodiles and hippos may be present where deeper water persists.",ai,informative
"Hospitals in Maine can be grouped by the communities they serve, reflecting the state’s mix of small coastal towns, inland regional hubs, and sparsely populated northern counties. In the capital area of Augusta (Kennebec County), major facilities include MaineGeneral Medical Center’s Alfond Center for Health, along with Riverview Psychiatric Center, a state psychiatric hospital that has operated under earlier names in the past.

Bangor (Penobscot County) functions as a key medical center for eastern Maine. Large institutions there include Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center, St. Joseph Hospital, Northern Light Acadia Hospital, and the Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center, which also has a history of previous institutional names. Farther down the coast in Hancock County, Mount Desert Island Hospital serves Bar Harbor, while Northern Light Blue Hill Hospital supports the Blue Hill area. Ellsworth is home to Northern Light Maine Coast Hospital.

Several midcoast and central Maine towns host community hospitals. Belfast (Waldo County) has Waldo County General Hospital, and Rockport (Knox County) is served by Penobscot Bay Medical Center. In Brunswick (Cumberland County), Mid Coast Hospital is a key provider, and Portland, the largest city in Maine, includes Maine Medical Center and Northern Light Mercy Hospital. Westbrook also hosts Spring Harbor Hospital.

Rural regions rely on smaller hospitals that provide emergency care and basic inpatient services. Examples include Bridgton Hospital (Cumberland County), Calais Regional Hospital and Down East Community Hospital in Machias (Washington County), and Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington (Franklin County). Northern and western Maine facilities include Cary Medical Center in Caribou, Northern Maine Medical Center in Fort Kent, Houlton Regional Hospital, Northern Light A.R.

Additional community hospitals serve towns such as Lewiston, Skowhegan, Rumford, and Dover-Foxcroft, helping maintain access across long travel distances.",ai,informative
"Liam Henderson (born 14 July 1979) is an Australian former lightweight rower who competed internationally in both sculling and sweep disciplines. Across a career spanning his junior years through to senior selection, he raced at major regattas including World Cups and World Championships, earned an under‑23 world title, and contributed to a medal-winning crew at the senior level.

**Club and state rowing**  
Henderson grew up in the Hawkesbury region of New South Wales and learned the sport through local river rowing before progressing to senior competition with the Hawkesbury River Rowing Club. Like many Australian lightweight athletes, he balanced domestic racing with selection trials that determined state and national crews.

His first significant domestic results came in age-category events, where he developed a reputation as a technically tidy sculler. Competing in club colours at the Australian Rowing Championships, he won a national under‑23 lightweight sculling title in the late 1990s. Those performances brought him to the attention of state selectors, and he later raced for New South Wales at the Interstate Regatta in the men’s lightweight four, the crew that contests the Penrith Cup. He appeared in that event more than once, reflecting consistent standing within the state’s lightweight squad.

**International representative rowing**  
Henderson’s Australian representative pathway began in the mid‑1990s, when he was selected for junior national crews. He first raced overseas as part of a quad scull at the Nations Cup (the major under‑23 regatta of the era), gaining early experience against European programs. In the same season he went on to contest the Junior World Rowing Championships, an event that often exposes young athletes to the demands of travel, unfamiliar conditions, and multi-round racing.

He also took part in a junior Trans‑Tasman series against New Zealand, a set of annual match races used by both countries to develop depth and evaluate emerging athletes. Returning the following year for the same series, he strengthened his case for under‑23 selection.

By 1997 Henderson had progressed into the under‑23 lightweight double scull, where he and his crewmate reached the podium at the World Rowing U23 Championships. The next step came in 1999, when he debuted in senior international competition at a World Rowing Cup regatta in the lightweight single scull. That season he peaked at the U23 World Championships, where he won the lightweight single scull and secured an under‑23 world championship title.

After transitioning from sculling into sweep rowing, Henderson earned selection in Australia’s men’s lightweight eight, a boat class that requires precise rhythm and high aerobic capacity. The crew achieved strong results on the World Cup circuit and later raced at the World Rowing Championships, where they finished on the medal dais. He continued to compete across both sculling and sweep boats into the early 2000s, including further World Cup appearances and a final World Championships campaign before retiring from international representation.",ai,informative
"Friedrich Wilhelm Heller (3 May 1801 in Ulm – 18 February 1874 in Karlsruhe) was a German physician known for his work in internal medicine and anatomical research. He began his medical training at the universities of Würzburg and Munich, completing his doctorate in 1822. After finishing his studies, he broadened his practical experience by working in teaching hospitals in Prague and Leipzig, where he observed new approaches to bedside instruction and post‑mortem examination.

In 1825 Heller entered public service as a medical officer attached to a cavalry unit stationed near Mannheim. A few years later he moved to Karlsruhe, where he combined military duties with responsibilities at a civic hospital. In 1831 he undertook a study journey to Paris and Edinburgh, focusing on clinical methods, hospital organization, and the growing use of microscopy in pathology.

From 1834 until his retirement in 1866, Heller held a chair in clinical medicine at the University of Heidelberg. He delivered lectures on diagnosis and therapeutics and encouraged students to connect symptoms with organ changes seen in autopsy findings. Alongside his academic work, he served as a medical adviser to the government of Baden, contributing to discussions on sanitation, epidemic control, and the regulation of medical practice.

Heller is also remembered for early arguments that many diseases arise from alterations at the smallest structural level of tissues, a view that anticipated later cellular explanations in medicine. His publications included a study on inflammatory processes (1828), a collection of clinical case reports (1836), a two‑volume handbook of internal diseases (1845–1846), and a later essay on practical treatment principles (1865).",ai,informative
"Ometepe Airport is the main air facility serving Ometepe, a large island located in Lake Nicaragua. It sits near the community of La Paloma in the municipality of Moyogalpa, within the Rivas Department, a short distance south of the town center. Opened in 2014 after a multi‑million‑dollar construction project, the airport was designed to fit the island’s narrow lowlands between the lake and the nearby volcanic terrain.

The runway lies close to the water’s edge, so aircraft approaching from the west typically fly over Lake Nicaragua. To the east, the land rises quickly toward the slopes of Concepción volcano, a prominent landmark that influences local flight paths and navigation considerations.

Pilots in the region also rely on radio navigation aids located on the mainland, including the Managua VOR/DME to the northwest and the Liberia VOR/DME farther to the south. These beacons help aircraft maintain routes and position, especially in changing weather.

Scheduled service is limited. One domestic carrier operates periodic circuit flights that connect the island with other Nicaraguan airports, including Managua on selected days. While the airport has facilities for immigration and customs, routine international commercial flights are not currently offered. Charter operations and private aircraft, such as small planes and helicopters, also use the terminal.",ai,informative
"Imran Masood, HI(M), is a retired senior officer of the Pakistan Army who held several high-profile appointments at General Headquarters (GHQ), including service as Chief of General Staff during the early 2010s. The CGS role is widely regarded as one of the most influential staff positions in the army because it coordinates operational planning, manages inter-branch staff work, and supports the Chief of Army Staff in translating policy decisions into military directives. Over a long career, Masood built a reputation as an officer with experience spanning command, training, and strategic planning.

Masood was commissioned into the Armoured Corps in the mid-1970s after graduating from the Pakistan Military Academy. Like many officers who rise to the highest ranks, he completed a sequence of professional military education courses. These typically include the Command and Staff College in Quetta, where officers are trained in staff procedures and operational art, and the National Defence University in Islamabad, which focuses on higher-level strategy, civil-military relations, and national security policy. He also attended a foreign staff course in Turkey, reflecting the practice of sending selected officers abroad to broaden exposure to different doctrines and coalition planning methods.

During his mid-career years, Masood alternated between field command and staff responsibilities. He served as a brigade major in an armoured formation and later worked as an instructor at leading training institutions, including the Pakistan Military Academy and the School of Infantry and Tactics. Instructional postings are significant in the army’s career structure because they place officers in roles where they shape curricula, mentor younger officers, and contribute to professional standards. On the command side, he led an armoured regiment and later commanded brigades in both armoured and infantry settings, assignments that required balancing mobility, firepower, and coordination with supporting arms.

His staff experience included postings in the Military Operations Directorate, where officers handle operational monitoring, contingency planning, and coordination with corps headquarters. After promotion to major general in the mid-2000s, Masood commanded a mechanized division in southern Punjab, a role combining administration, training oversight, and readiness planning. He subsequently served as Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations, acting as the army’s principal spokesperson and overseeing public communication during a period of heightened security attention.

Later, he moved to GHQ’s planning and evaluation functions. As Director General Planning at the COAS Secretariat, he worked within a policy-focused environment often described as the army’s internal planning hub. He then served as Vice Chief of General Staff before promotion to lieutenant general and appointment as Inspector General Training and Evaluation, supervising training standards, exercises, and evaluation systems across formations. He ultimately became Chief of General Staff, after which he retired from active service.

Masood is married and has three children.",ai,informative
"Sriboonruang Wittayakarn School, often known locally as Sibunrueang, is a major public secondary school in Nong Bua Lamphu Province, northeastern Thailand. The campus is situated in Ban Santisuk (Mu 13) within Sriboonrueng District and serves as one of the central educational institutions for students in the surrounding communities. Administratively, the school operates under the regional Secondary Educational Service Area Office responsible for overseeing public secondary education in the province.

The school’s establishment is closely tied to the limited access to upper-level schooling in earlier decades. Before the mid-1970s, many students who completed primary education in the district faced difficulties continuing their studies because the nearest secondary schools were located far away and transportation options were limited. Local leaders and residents therefore pushed for a district-based secondary school. Initial planning began several years earlier, but the effort progressed slowly until district authorities compiled the necessary documentation and submitted it to national education agencies. Formal approval was granted in 1974, marking the beginning of the school as an official government institution.

When the school first opened to students in 1974, it started with only a small number of classes and a modest first intake. Demand quickly increased, and over time the school expanded its buildings, teaching staff, and grade-level offerings. Today it provides both lower secondary and upper secondary education, with a range of academic programs designed to prepare students for higher education and vocational pathways. Like many Thai secondary schools, it also tracks performance through national assessments in core subjects such as Thai language, mathematics, science, social studies, and English.",ai,informative
"Ralph McQuarrie (1929–2012) was an American illustrator and conceptual artist whose futuristic imagery helped shape the look of modern science-fiction film. He is most widely associated with the original Star Wars trilogy, where his paintings guided sets, costumes, vehicles, and the overall atmosphere of a galaxy far from Earth. McQuarrie’s work is often described as a bridge between written ideas and what audiences eventually see on screen, translating scripts into believable worlds through detailed visual planning.

McQuarrie was born in Gary, Indiana, and developed an interest in drawing and engineering-related subjects early in life. After serving in the U.S. Army, he studied at the Art Center School in Los Angeles, building a foundation in illustration and design. Before entering the film industry, he worked as a commercial artist, producing technical and promotional artwork that required clarity, precision, and strong draftsmanship—skills that later proved useful in concept design.

His transition into entertainment design accelerated in the mid-1970s, when filmmaker George Lucas sought visual development for a space adventure that had not yet been fully realized on film. McQuarrie produced a series of paintings that established key ideas for Star Wars, including interpretations of characters, spacecraft, and environments. Several of his designs directly influenced elements that became iconic, and his artwork was frequently used as a reference point for construction teams and special-effects departments. In this way, his paintings were not merely marketing images; they functioned as practical blueprints for production.

Following this breakthrough, McQuarrie contributed to other major projects, continuing to refine the visual language of science fiction. He worked on Close Encounters of the Third Kind, developing concepts related to spacecraft and lighting. Later, he provided designs for The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, helping to expand the universe introduced in the first film. He also contributed to E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, where his work supported the creation of locations, props, and mood.

A notable aspect of McQuarrie’s approach was his ability to make imaginative technology appear functional. He often combined real-world industrial details with dramatic composition, suggesting how a machine might be built, used, and maintained. This grounded quality helped audiences accept extraordinary settings as coherent places. Although concept art is typically produced behind the scenes, McQuarrie’s images became widely circulated through books, exhibitions, and documentaries, highlighting the importance of visual development in filmmaking.

McQuarrie’s legacy rests on the idea that design can define a story’s identity. By providing a consistent visual direction early in production, he influenced not only individual films but also the broader expectations of what cinematic science fiction could look like.",ai,informative
"Marco Bianchi (born 12 March 1950) is an Italian economist and academic based in Rome. He has spent much of his career at Sapienza University of Rome, where he completed his university studies and earned a degree in Economics in the early 1970s. His training was grounded in both economic theory and institutional analysis, an approach that later informed his teaching and administrative work within the university.

Over the years, Bianchi has held several governance and leadership positions connected to Sapienza’s Faculty of Law. In addition to teaching economics-related subjects to law students, he has coordinated initiatives aimed at strengthening the links between legal studies, public finance, and the organization of markets. He has served as head of an institute focused on economic and financial matters within the faculty, and has also taken responsibilities connected to internal evaluation procedures, such as reviewing teaching quality and supporting the assessment of departmental performance.

Beyond his roles at the university, Bianchi has contributed to national research oversight. He has acted as a reviewer for competitive research programs funded by the Italian Ministry responsible for universities and scientific research, evaluating proposals and monitoring ongoing projects. He has also participated in internal inspection and compliance activities, which in Italian universities often involve checking administrative regularity and ensuring that academic structures follow established regulations.

His involvement in postgraduate education includes participation in scientific committees for doctoral and master’s programs, particularly in areas where economics intersects with commercial law, European private law, and public policy. In these settings, he has helped define curricula, assess academic standards, and supervise research paths for early-career scholars.

During the earlier phase of his career, Bianchi received recognition for his graduation thesis, which was awarded in a competition sponsored by a local banking foundation. He has also served on academic selection panels at the national level, taking part in evaluation commissions for appointments and promotions across different ranks of the Italian university system.

Bianchi’s professional profile reflects a combination of scholarship, institutional service, and participation in research evaluation, typical of senior Italian academics working at large public universities.",ai,informative
"Kandola Kalan is a rural settlement in the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district of Punjab, India. It lies within the Doaba region and is connected to nearby market towns by local roads. For postal and administrative purposes, the village falls under the service area of a nearby head post office, while the district headquarters at Nawanshahr and the state capital Chandigarh can be reached by road. Like most villages in Punjab, local civic matters are handled through a Gram Panchayat system, led by a Sarpanch who is chosen through village-level elections.

According to the 2011 Census of India, Kandola Kalan had 372 households and a population of 1,734 residents. Of these, 904 were males and 830 were females. The village reported a literacy rate of 79.6%, which is above the overall literacy level recorded for Punjab in the same census period. Children aged six and below numbered 171, representing just under one-tenth of the total population. The child sex ratio was notably higher than the state average, indicating a comparatively larger number of girls per thousand boys in the youngest age group.

Social composition in the village includes a substantial share of residents belonging to Scheduled Castes, forming roughly two-thirds of the population. As in many parts of this district, the Scheduled Tribe population is either very small or not recorded. Work participation figures show that 658 people were engaged in some form of economic activity, including 497 men and 161 women. Most workers were classified as main workers, meaning they were employed for more than six months of the year, while the remaining group carried out seasonal or short-term work.

In education, the village is served by a Punjabi-medium government school offering primary and upper primary classes. The school follows national guidelines for free and compulsory schooling for children aged 6 to 14 and provides cooked meals under the Mid-Day Meal programme. For higher education, students typically commute to colleges in nearby towns such as Banga or Nawanshahr, while larger private universities are accessible in other parts of Punjab.

For transport, the nearest railway facilities are found in the surrounding towns, with broader connectivity available from larger stations in the district. Domestic air travel is generally accessed through the airport in Ludhiana, while international flights are available from Chandigarh and Amritsar.",ai,informative
"Emma Chambers (1848–1933) was an English mezzo-soprano and stage performer whose career bridged Victorian London and the rapidly growing theatrical scene of Australia. Known for lively character work as well as singing roles, she became especially familiar to audiences in the Australian colonies during the 1880s and early 1890s.

Chambers first gained wide notice in London through parts that mixed music with comedy and disguise. Early successes included breeches roles in which she played male characters onstage, a popular convention in the period. Her appearances at prominent venues helped establish her reputation for energetic acting and clear vocal delivery, and she soon moved between pantomime, comic plays, and light opera—genres that drew large mixed audiences and relied on performers with versatility rather than purely operatic technique.

During the mid-1870s she worked under contract in productions of fashionable continental operettas, which were often adapted for English stages. These engagements placed her in a circuit of major London theatres where French and German works were translated, revised, and mounted with elaborate staging. She later took on named roles in well-known operettas by composers such as Lecocq and Planquette, including a notable engagement at a central London theatre arranged by a leading theatre proprietor of the day. By 1880 she was also appearing in English comic opera, reflecting the period’s appetite for locally written works that blended popular song styles with theatrical comedy.

In October 1884 Chambers travelled to Australia under contract to a major theatrical partnership to repeat a role that had brought her recognition in Britain. Melbourne audiences, in particular, welcomed imported performers from London, and Chambers quickly became part of touring companies that carried large-scale productions between colonial capitals. Over the next years she appeared in a range of popular dramas and melodramas, taking on parts that demanded strong characterisation as much as vocal ability.

In 1889 she left Australia for South Africa with a company formed under her leadership, travelling by steamship with members of her family and troupe. After a visit to England in 1891, she returned again to the southern hemisphere, passing through South Africa and then Australia, where she performed in a production mounted by a leading actor-manager.

By the early twentieth century Chambers was back on the English stage, including a substantial role in a London theatre in 1901. In her personal life she married Albert Marsh, who also acted as her manager, and she was at times associated with another married name. She died in 1933, remembered as a capable, adaptable performer whose career followed the pathways of the British Empire’s theatre circuits.",ai,informative
"The 4th Canadian Film Awards took place on April 27, 1952, recognizing notable work in Canadian cinema across a range of formats. The event was presided over by Sidney Earle Smith, who at the time served as president of the University of Toronto. Awards were organized into categories that reflected both theatrical productions and films made for educational or institutional use, with additional acknowledgements given through honourable mentions.

In the top prize category, Film of the Year went to *Newfoundland Scene*, produced by F. R. Crawley. The award for Theatrical Feature was presented to *Royal Journey*, credited to David Bairstow, Gudrun Parker, and Roger Blais, while *Little Aurore’s Tragedy (La petite Aurore, l’enfant martyre)* received an honourable mention. The Theatrical Short category recognized *Opera School* (Gudrun Parker), alongside honourable mentions for *The Fruitful Earth*, *Man in the Peace Tower*, and *Struggle for Oil*.

Non-theatrical awards were further divided by sponsorship. *Newfoundland Scene* also won in the open non-theatrical division, with other works cited for distinction, including *The Longhouse People* and *Les Moines de Saint-Benoît-du-Lac*. In government-sponsored non-theatrical film, *Milk Made* received the main award, and *Ski à Québec* was commended. *Packaged Power* led the non-government sponsored group, while several club and university productions were also acknowledged. A special award honoured Norman McLaren for innovative research reflected in *Around Is Around* and *Now Is the Time*.",ai,informative
"BWI Group (BeijingWest Industries) is an automotive components supplier specializing in braking and suspension technologies. The company is headquartered in Beijing, China, and serves a broad customer base that includes passenger car makers, motorcycle brands, and manufacturers of specialized vehicles. A major turning point came in 2009, when BWI acquired Delphi’s Chassis Division, adding established product lines and engineering capability to its portfolio. The acquisition was reported at roughly $100 million and helped position the firm as a global supplier.

Although the BWI name dates from the 2009 transaction, much of the technical heritage behind its products traces back to earlier North American chassis and brake organizations that evolved through multiple corporate names over the 20th century. This long development path reflects the way braking and suspension systems have advanced from primarily mechanical devices to integrated, electronically controlled safety platforms.

BWI’s manufacturing footprint is international, with production operations in several regions, including China and a number of European locations such as Poland, the United Kingdom, and the Czech Republic, along with facilities in Mexico. This spread supports proximity to vehicle assembly plants and helps meet regional supply requirements.

The product range has expanded over time from early shock absorbers to sophisticated chassis systems. Historical milestones include drum brake hydraulics, welded damper designs, vacuum brake boosters, and the introduction of disc brake components. Later decades brought anti-lock braking systems, modular struts, electronic stability control, and adaptive damping technologies. In the 2000s, magnetorheological damping systems became prominent, and ABS solutions were extended to motorcycle applications.",ai,informative
"Ashani Kemarley Brown (born 20 July 1992) is a sprinter known for racing the 100 metres and 200 metres. Competing at elite level, he has recorded a best of 9.93 seconds over 100 m, a time that places him among the faster athletes of his generation. His career has included representing more than one nation and combining athletics with studies in the United States.

Brown began his international exposure while still a junior athlete for Jamaica. One of his earliest achievements came in relay competition, where he helped Jamaica’s 4 × 100 metres team secure a medal at the CARIFTA Games in 2011. That success suggested strong promise, although his progress was later slowed by injuries that disrupted training and competition during a key development period.

To continue both education and sport, Brown relocated to the United States and enrolled at Merritt College in Oakland, California. Competing in the American junior college system, he made steady improvements, particularly in strength and race durability. He became a leading performer at the California Community College level and earned state titles in the 100 m. A major breakthrough came at the CCCAA State Track and Field Championships in 2014, where he ran 9.93 seconds. The performance was significant not only as a personal best, but also for its standing within junior college athletics, and it ranked highly worldwide for that season. In the same year, he also posted a 200 m best of 20.38 seconds, placing him competitively on international seasonal lists.

In 2015, Brown continued racing on the Caribbean circuit, including appearances at meets in Kingston. Later that year he initiated a change in sporting nationality, requesting a transfer of allegiance from Jamaica to Bahrain. Such moves are governed by international athletics regulations and typically involve approval processes before an athlete can represent a new country in major championships.

Brown went on to compete for Bahrain at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. In the men’s 100 m, he progressed through the opening round and reached the semi-finals, running 10.13 seconds in the qualifying stage. His primary personal bests remain 9.93 seconds for 100 m and 20.38 seconds for 200 m, both achieved in 2014.",ai,informative
"What Remains is a short work by the German author Christa Wolf that explores the psychological effects of political monitoring in the former German Democratic Republic. Although it was composed in 1979, it appeared in print only in 1990, a delay that reflects the political sensitivities surrounding its subject and the changes that followed the collapse of East Germany.

The narrative follows a single ordinary day experienced by an unnamed woman who senses that state security agents are tracking her movements and professional life. Instead of focusing on dramatic events, the text concentrates on how constant observation reshapes routine behavior. Simple actions—answering the phone, speaking with friends, leaving the apartment—become calculated choices. The protagonist’s home no longer feels private; it becomes a space where every word might be recorded or misinterpreted.

Wolf presents surveillance not only as an external system but also as an internal condition. The woman begins to scrutinize herself as harshly as she imagines others do. Doubt and anxiety influence her body as well as her thoughts, producing signs of stress such as sleeplessness and nervous agitation. Social life shrinks because trust becomes difficult: casual conversations are replaced by guarded remarks, hints, and indirect language.

A recurring element is her fascination with the watchers themselves. She wonders about their motives, their everyday habits, and whether they can separate their work from their private lives. This curiosity reveals how surveillance creates a distorted relationship between observer and observed, binding them together even without direct contact.

Told in a reflective first-person voice, the novella draws readers into an ongoing inner commentary. By the end, encounters with younger people at a public reading suggest that fear can be challenged, and that speaking openly may eventually become possible—even if the legacy of suspicion remains.",ai,informative
"A large carved elephant tusk showing episodes from the Buddha’s life is displayed in the Decorative Arts gallery of the National Museum in New Delhi. The object is fashioned from a single, intact tusk and measures close to five feet in length. It entered the museum collection as a donation and is generally attributed to skilled ivory workers active in the Delhi area in the early decades of the twentieth century. The tusk is notable both for its scale and for the dense narrative program cut into its curved surface.

Carving on whole tusks became an admired form of luxury craft in India during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with Delhi recognized as an important center, along with workshops in Burma. Comparable full-tusk carvings are known in parts of West and Central Africa as well, though those were typically made from African elephant ivory. In South Asia, ivory working has a long history: classical literature mentions finely made ivory objects, and archaeological finds indicate the presence of carved pieces from at least the early centuries of the Common Era. The practice expanded in regions such as Assam and Mysore, where access to elephants and support from royal courts helped sustain specialist artisans. Because ivory was widely traded, raw material and finished works circulated to places where patrons valued the craft.

The New Delhi tusk presents a continuous visual biography of the Buddha through forty-three circular medallions arranged in a spiraling sequence. The lower portion begins with events associated with his birth and youth and continues through key moments leading to awakening. The upper medallions then move to episodes after enlightenment, culminating in his final passing. While many scenes echo established Buddhist sculpture and painting, the tusk also includes less frequently illustrated moments, such as an early encounter involving compassion toward an injured animal and reflections that emphasize ethical change and the reality of death.

As the tusk narrows toward the tip, the carving shifts from narrative medallions to prominent iconic figures. Here, several well-known hand gestures are shown, including the earth-touching gesture, the gesture of reassurance, and the gesture associated with teaching. A band of scrolling floral ornament winds between the medallions, linking the episodes and providing a decorative framework for the story as it rises from base to tip.",ai,informative
"The Washington Road Elm Allée is a notable segment of Washington Road in West Windsor, New Jersey, where rows of elm trees frame the roadway and shape a distinctive approach to Princeton University. The tree-lined corridor passes through open university-owned fields and, together with the nearby crossing over Lake Carnegie, creates a strong visual gateway into the campus area. At the northern end of this landscaped stretch, the Delaware and Raritan Canal runs close to the road, linking the allée to one of central New Jersey’s best-known historic waterways.

A paved running and walking route follows the allée and serves as a connector between several destinations. From this corridor, pedestrians can continue onto the canal towpath, head toward Princeton’s main campus, or branch off onto additional trails that weave through surrounding meadows and farmland. Because it combines scenic views with practical access, the route is used for recreation as well as daily travel by students, residents, and visitors.

The planting of the original allée dates to the early twentieth century, when Princeton Nurseries played a major role in regional landscape projects. The trees were chosen for their upright form and their ability to create a shaded arch overhead as they matured. The Princeton Elm, a cultivated variety associated with the nursery, became particularly valued for its appearance and for improved tolerance to Dutch elm disease, which devastated elm populations across the United States. Over the decades, the allée has inevitably changed: some of the original trees have been lost to age, storms, and disease, while others have survived and grown into large specimens. To preserve the characteristic look of the corridor, replacement plantings have been added at different times, including other elm cultivars as well as a smaller number of non-elm trees.

Just east of the roadway, near the path, lies a small historic cemetery known as the Schenck-Covenhoven Burial Ground, also referred to locally as the Old Conover Graveyard. Enclosed by a stone boundary, it contains several dozen graves and is considered one of the oldest burial sites in the township, with interments dating back to the mid-1700s. The families associated with the site were early Dutch farming settlers in the area, and although the cemetery has not been used for many generations, it is still cared for on a limited basis.",ai,informative
"The CECAFA Club Cup is a regional football competition for club teams affiliated with the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (CECAFA). The event brings together leading sides from the association’s member countries and serves as an important platform for clubs that may not regularly appear in continental tournaments. Since the early 2000s, the tournament has also been widely referred to under a sponsored name, reflecting the role of external backing in keeping the competition active.

The origins of the cup go back to the late 1960s, when an early edition was played but later treated as unofficial in many records. After that initial attempt, the tournament experienced interruptions and did not develop into a consistent annual event until later in the 1970s, when a champion was formally recognised. Over time, the competition has continued to face occasional cancellations, often due to scheduling difficulties, funding constraints, or wider organisational issues.

Match outcomes in the CECAFA Club Cup have frequently been decided in knockout rounds. When finals end level after regulation time and extra time, champions are determined through penalty shootouts, which are recorded alongside the scoreline. Lists of winners typically distinguish between champions and runners-up and may include notes on club name changes and how titles are counted. Statistics are also commonly summarised by nation to show which countries’ clubs have been most successful.",ai,informative
"Samuel L. Rabinowitz (April 12, 1881 – June 3, 1938) was a Russian-born Jewish-American attorney, public official, and municipal judge associated with New York City politics in the early twentieth century. His career reflected a common path for immigrants of his generation: public schooling, professional training, work in local party organizations, and eventual service in government.

Rabinowitz was born on April 12, 1881 in Odessa, then part of the Russian Empire, to Leon and Fannie Rabinowitz. He arrived in the United States as a child and spent much of his youth on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, an area known for dense immigrant neighborhoods and active political clubs. He attended New York City public schools and later enrolled at the College of the City of New York, studying there from 1897 to 1900. Seeking a legal career, he continued to New York Law School and completed his degree in 1902. After admission to the bar, he opened a practice in lower Manhattan, maintaining offices near City Hall where many lawyers handled court and municipal matters.

Soon after establishing his practice, Rabinowitz became involved in Democratic Party organizations in his assembly district. He joined local political clubs, attended ward meetings, and worked on campaigns, activities that provided experience and connections in an era when party structures strongly influenced nominations and appointments. His visibility within the district helped him win election to the New York State Assembly, where he represented a Manhattan constituency beginning in 1909. He served two terms, focusing on legislation related to city administration, public safety, and court procedure. Though identified with the Democratic organization, he also gained support from reform-minded voters during a period when New York politics included frequent challenges from independent movements.

After leaving the Assembly, Rabinowitz returned to private practice while remaining active in civic affairs. He participated in legal associations and served on committees that addressed municipal governance and court efficiency. In 1926, he was elected to the Municipal Court of the City of New York, a busy trial court that handled a large volume of civil cases and minor criminal matters. As a judge, he was known for a steady courtroom style and attention to the practical effects of rulings on working residents and small businesses.

Rabinowitz married Rebecca Stein, and they had two children, Philip and Marian. He died on June 3, 1938 after a short illness and was buried at a Jewish cemetery in Queens. His professional life illustrates how immigrant lawyers could move from neighborhood advocacy to formal roles in New York’s legal and political institutions.",ai,informative
"Hans Richter (6 April 1888 – 1 February 1976) was a German painter, filmmaker, and writer known for connecting the European avant‑garde with the emerging language of experimental cinema. Active as both an organizer and a creator, he helped introduce abstract film to wider audiences and worked across several countries as political conditions in Europe shifted. His career illustrates how modernist art, journalism, and film production often overlapped in the first half of the twentieth century.

Richter was born in Berlin into a middle‑class family and trained in art at academies in Germany. During the First World War he became involved in artistic circles that questioned traditional forms and institutions. After the war he joined the Dada movement, collaborating with poets, designers, and musicians who favored collage, chance methods, and sharp cultural critique. These contacts were important because they provided a network of publishers, editors, and patrons who could support new work outside established galleries and studios.

In the early 1920s Richter began making abstract films that explored rhythm, contrast, and movement rather than narrative. Works such as *Rhythmus 21* and *Rhythmus 23* used animated geometric forms to investigate how editing and visual repetition could create a sense of time comparable to music. At a moment when cinema was still associated mainly with theatrical storytelling, these films argued that motion pictures could also function as a modern visual art. Richter wrote essays and gave lectures to explain these ideas, treating film as a distinct medium with its own grammar.

Alongside his filmmaking, he undertook editorial and organizational roles. He contributed to art journals, worked with exhibition groups, and promoted international exchanges between artists. This public work was not separate from his artistic output: it helped build an audience and a critical vocabulary for experimental film and modern design. During the late Weimar period he also collaborated with other filmmakers and photographers who were developing documentary and city‑film approaches, showing his ability to move between abstraction and socially oriented projects.

The political upheavals of the 1930s reshaped Richter’s life. As the Nazi regime targeted modernist artists and those with left‑leaning associations, he left Germany and lived in several European countries before eventually moving to the United States. In New York he taught, wrote about film history and technique, and continued to make and support independent productions. His work as a teacher mattered because it connected early European experimentation with later American avant‑garde cinema.

Richter’s legacy lies in his insistence that film could be both an artistic experiment and a form of critical commentary. By combining creative practice with editorial advocacy, he helped establish experimental cinema as a recognized field within twentieth‑century culture.",ai,informative
"Heathfield Park is a historic country estate in the village of Old Heathfield, East Sussex. The property is notable for its long sequence of owners, repeated architectural changes, and landscaped grounds that include both designed features and areas valued for wildlife.

The estate began life in the late seventeenth century as a private mansion set within parkland. Work started in 1677 under James Plummer, and further building followed in the early eighteenth century under Raymond Blackmore. Like many English country houses, it evolved in response to the tastes and ambitions of successive proprietors rather than being built to a single fixed plan.

A major turning point came in the 1760s when George Augustus Eliott acquired the property after accumulating significant wealth through military service, including prize money connected with the 1762 siege of Havana. Soon after his purchase, the house was expanded and updated in 1766 to designs by Robert Taylor, an architect who later received a knighthood. Eliott retained the estate until his death in 1790, and the house subsequently took the name Heathfield Park in recognition of his title.

In the following year, the new owner Francis Newbery, whose family was connected to the publisher John Newbery, employed landscape designer Humphrey Repton to improve the grounds. One of the most distinctive elements of the estate dates from this period: the Gibraltar Tower, built as a commemorative structure celebrating Eliott’s role in the defence of Gibraltar during the siege of 1779–1782. The tower combines an octagonal lower stage with a circular upper section, and visitors reach the top via a spiral stair contained within. It is listed at Grade II*, reflecting its architectural and historic interest.

During the nineteenth century, the estate served for decades as the home of the Blunt baronet family. Later, the art patron William Cleverley Alexander undertook a substantial remodelling in 1895, commissioning Sir Reginald Blomfield to reshape the house in a Georgian Revival manner. Among the visible changes were the replacement of stucco with brick facing and the addition of a new wing. Alexander died in 1916 after a fall inside the house.

In the mid-twentieth century the estate entered a new phase when Gerald Moore purchased it in 1963. He opened the gardens to the public, introduced equestrian facilities, restored the Gibraltar Tower in 1970, and later developed a wildlife park. The property was sold in 1993 and remains privately owned today.

Beyond its buildings, Heathfield Park includes an area designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. This status recognises the ecological value of the local ghyll woodland habitat and its county-important lichen communities. Part of the grounds also hosts Heathfield Park Cricket Club, established in 1878 and still supporting matches and training for adults and juniors.",ai,informative
"The Department of Civil, Geo and Environmental Engineering at the Technical University of Munich is based on the university’s Munich campus and brings together disciplines that deal with the built environment and natural systems. Its work spans classic civil engineering, the study of the Earth, and environmental technologies, with research and teaching aimed at improving infrastructure, managing resources, and understanding geological processes.

Within the department, chairs and research groups are commonly organized into several thematic clusters. One major area covers construction and building design, including energy-conscious architecture, building physics, and structural systems made from concrete, masonry, steel, and timber. Related fields examine construction materials and their performance, ranging from materials testing to methods that evaluate structures without causing damage.

A second cluster focuses on mobility and transportation. This includes traffic operations and control, as well as the planning and engineering of roads, railways, and airfields. Researchers also analyze transport systems and urban mobility patterns using modeling and simulation, supporting decisions in city and regional planning.

A third area concentrates on mechanics and management within engineering practice. Topics such as computational and structural mechanics, risk and reliability, and construction management address how complex projects are designed, assessed, and delivered. Real estate and infrastructure management may also be represented, reflecting the economic and organizational side of the built environment.

The fourth cluster highlights hydro- and geosciences. Research may involve hydrology, groundwater, river basin management, geothermal systems, landslides, and engineering geology, alongside urban water engineering and hydraulic design.

In addition, associated members contribute expertise in fields like geodesy, remote sensing, geoinformatics, land management, landscape planning, environmental monitoring, and digital fabrication. International subject rankings periodically evaluate the department’s broader fields, with positions varying by ranking organization and year.",ai,informative
"Lillias Margaret Skene (née Hamilton; 28 March 1867–25 March 1957) is remembered as an Australian advocate for women and a long-serving community organiser whose work linked social reform with practical support services.

Born in Smythesdale, Victoria, on 28 March 1867, she was the third child of John Prendergast Hamilton, a police magistrate originally from Scotland, and Agnes Margaret Hamilton (née Buchanan), who had English family connections. She was educated locally and later attended Alexandra College, where her schooling reflected the expectations of middle-class families at the time: a strong emphasis on discipline, civic responsibility, and preparation for public life through voluntary service.

On 7 November 1888, at St Mary’s Anglican Church in Caulfield, she married David Alexander Skene, a sheepmaster. Their early married years were marked by financial uncertainty, which shaped the family’s repeated moves and influenced Skene’s later interest in welfare and health initiatives. When employment drew her husband to New South Wales, she remained in Victoria with their children for extended periods, managing household responsibilities and maintaining family stability. The family reunited at rural stations near Bourke and later relocated several times in response to changing prospects in pastoral work.

In 1900 they moved to Manly, Sydney, where they attempted to earn a living from a small dairy operation on leased land. Drought conditions and the cost of fodder made the venture difficult, and by 1906 they returned to Melbourne. There, David Skene shifted into commercial work as a woolbroker and stock and station agent. In 1910, funds inherited from Lillias Skene’s mother enabled the purchase of a family home in South Yarra, providing a firmer base for her public activities.

Skene became involved in organised women’s networks in Victoria, including the National Council of Women. Working as an assistant secretary, she supported coordination between affiliated groups and helped sustain campaigns concerned with women’s status and social improvement. She also contributed to health administration, serving in roles connected to the governance of a women’s hospital committee and, during the First World War era, managing stores and operations for a Melbourne home hospital connected with Government House.

After gradually stepping back from many responsibilities in 1949, she moved to Brighton. She died in Armadale on 25 March 1957 and was buried at Brighton Cemetery. Her name endures in Skene Street in the Canberra suburb of Cook, reflecting recognition of her civic contribution.",ai,informative
"Ada Developers Academy is an intensive training program designed to prepare women and gender-expansive adults for entry-level roles in software development, particularly those who have not previously worked as professional programmers. One distinguishing feature of the academy is its tuition-free model, which helps reduce financial barriers to career change. To support participants with day-to-day costs while studying, the program also allows students to seek a small, low-interest loan intended for living expenses.

The curriculum is structured to combine guided instruction with real-world experience. Students typically begin with several months of full-time classroom learning, where they build a foundation in core programming concepts and modern web development practices. Coursework commonly emphasizes languages and tools used in industry, such as Python for backend development, JavaScript for interactive web applications, and frameworks and libraries used to build full products. Alongside coding skills, students study computer science essentials—topics like problem-solving approaches, data structures, and collaborative workflows that are necessary in professional engineering teams. HTML and CSS are also covered to support front-end fundamentals and user-facing design implementation.

After the instructional portion, participants move into a multi-month paid internship. These placements are hosted by technology companies in the Seattle area and are intended to give students experience working on production code, receiving feedback through code review, and collaborating with cross-functional teams. Partner organizations have included well-known firms across e-commerce, enterprise software, and consumer technology.

Many companies engage with programs like this to broaden their hiring pipelines and strengthen diversity within technical roles.",ai,informative
"San Esteban is one of the municipalities located in the northeastern part of Honduras, within the department of Olancho. It lies between several well-known localities in the region: Dulce Nombre de Culmí is to the east, Gualaco to the west, and Catacamas to the south. The area has also appeared in literature, since a Costa Rican novelist, Óscar Núñez Oliva, used San Esteban as the setting for a novel published in 2000.

The municipality’s name commemorates friar Esteban Verdelete, a religious figure remembered for his work in spreading Christianity among communities in the zone. Local tradition identifies 1808 as the year of its establishment, linked to friar José Antonio Liendo y Goicoechea, who traveled from Guatemala and played a role in organizing the settlement. In its early years, the population included indigenous inhabitants who already lived in the surrounding lands.

Geographically, San Esteban occupies a section of the Agalta Valley and is traversed by the Grande de Agalta River, which is an important feature for the landscape and local agriculture. Its territory shares borders with Trujillo and Iriona to the north, Catacamas to the south, Dulce Nombre de Culmí to the east, and Gualaco to the west. Administratively, it includes more than twenty villages distributed across its valleys and hillsides.",ai,informative
"*The Ghost-Seer* (German: *Der Geisterseher – Aus den Papieren des Grafen von O***) is a prose work by Friedrich Schiller that occupies an unusual place in his career. Rather than being released at once as a finished book, it first reached readers in parts between 1787 and 1789 in Schiller’s periodical *Thalia*. Only later was it gathered and issued in multiple volumes. This publication history is important because the text reflects its serial origins: it shifts in pacing and emphasis, and it does not form a perfectly unified narrative arc.

The story is presented as a first-person account attributed to an unnamed “Count of O**,” who frames what follows as testimony rather than invention. He underscores that the events he describes may sound implausible but insists on their factuality, and he adopts the stance of a narrator who claims to have nothing to gain from persuading his readers. This device creates an atmosphere of documentary authenticity, which becomes especially effective as the plot moves into the territory of deception, staged marvels, and secret influence.

At the center of the narrative is a German prince who travels to Venice during the carnival season. The Venetian setting is not merely decorative: masks, anonymity, and spectacle support a sequence of encounters in which appearances are difficult to verify. The prince is gradually drawn into a web of manipulation involving a clandestine religious-political network, often described in terms of Jesuit intrigue. Their objective is to reshape his convictions and steer his future rule, using theatrical tricks and purported supernatural phenomena to break down his resistance and redirect his loyalties.

Alongside its sensational elements, the work also gestures toward the intellectual climate of the late Enlightenment. Schiller uses the prince’s predicament to explore tensions between impulse and ethical restraint, personal desire and public obligation. Digressions on religion, history, and the uses of power reveal a skeptical attitude toward institutional authority and highlight the period’s fascination with rational critique, even when the plot is fueled by apparitions and conspiracies.

Although Schiller never completed the novel, it achieved wide popularity in his lifetime, partly because it borrowed motifs associated with Gothic fiction—spiritualism, secret societies, and ominous “proofs” of the beyond. Readers and commentators have sometimes linked its themes to contemporary fascination with occult showmen and staged séances. The book also traveled early: an English version appeared around 1800, helping to establish its reputation outside German-speaking audiences. Later attempts to supply an ending, including a continuation published in the twentieth century, did not fully replace the appeal of the fragment as Schiller left it: a hybrid of philosophical inquiry and suspenseful illusion.",ai,informative
"Ronnie Shields is an American football player known for lining up at tight end, and he has spent time seeking opportunities at the professional level. Born in Los Angeles to Ron and Victoria Shields, he later moved to Georgia and attended Stephenson High School in Stone Mountain, finishing in 2010. Notably, he was a late starter in the sport, only taking up football during his junior year of high school, yet he developed enough to attract college interest.

Shields committed to the University of Kentucky in late 2009 and arrived on campus in the summer of 2010. He remained with the Wildcats program through 2014, building his experience at the collegiate level in a competitive conference.

After college, Shields entered the 2015 NFL Draft but was not selected. He worked to earn a roster spot by attending the Seattle Seahawks’ rookie minicamp that May, though it did not immediately result in a contract. Early in 2016, Seattle signed him to a futures deal, a type of agreement commonly used to bring players into offseason programs. Over the following months, he was waived, brought back, and later released again with an injury designation as roster decisions were made ahead of the season.",ai,informative
"Vzyado was an Argentine post-punk group from Buenos Aires that emerged in 1982 during a period of rapid growth in the city’s independent music circuit. The band became known for a tense, rhythmic sound built on sharp guitar patterns, elastic bass lines, and vocal delivery that shifted between spoken and melodic phrases. Critics often linked their approach to the broader post-punk movement, citing parallels with British and Latin American acts that blended punk energy with funk-inflected grooves and experimental arrangements. Although their initial run was short, Vzyado later returned for a series of reunion performances and releases.

The band formed when bassist Paula Rinaldi and vocalist-guitarist Martín “Tino” Ledesma began collaborating after meeting at small concerts in the San Telmo area. They soon recruited guitarist Federico Sosa, whose interest in angular, percussive playing complemented Rinaldi’s driving bass work, and drummer Javier Paredes, who had previously played in local new wave projects. From the beginning, Vzyado rehearsed and recorded with limited resources, which pushed them toward a stripped-down style emphasizing rhythm and texture over polished production.

Their first full-length record, Grabación en Taller, appeared in 1984 through a small independent imprint that specialized in underground rock. Despite its title suggesting a concert album, it was actually recorded live in a rehearsal space with minimal overdubs. The choice was partly aesthetic, but also practical: studio time was expensive, and the group wanted to capture the intensity of their stage sound. The album circulated widely via tape trading and college radio, helping the band build a reputation beyond Buenos Aires.

In 1985, internal scheduling pressures began to affect the lineup. Sosa increasingly focused on a separate project that was gaining commercial attention, and he departed later that year. As a trio, Vzyado recorded their second album, Entre Sombras, released in 1986. Compared with the debut, it featured more space in the arrangements and a heavier use of repetitive motifs, reflecting the band’s interest in dance rhythms and early industrial textures. Shortly after the album’s release, the group stopped performing. Members later pointed to uneven promotion, financial difficulties, and growing personal responsibilities as key factors in the decision.

Vzyado resurfaced in 2004, with Rinaldi and Ledesma returning alongside a new drummer, Nicolás Albornoz, after Paredes had moved abroad. The reunion led to festival appearances and club dates, and several older tracks were licensed for an international compilation focused on Latin American post-punk. In 2009, the band released a short EP, Rastro, their first new material in over two decades. Activity gradually slowed in the following years, and the project ended after Ledesma’s death in 2016.

Over time, Vzyado came to represent a particular strand of South American post-punk: resourceful, rhythm-centered, and shaped as much by local scenes as by global influences.",ai,informative
"UEFA Group H formed part of the European qualifying programme for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, one of nine groups used to determine which national teams from UEFA would reach the tournament in Russia. The section eventually included six sides: Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Estonia, Cyprus, and Gibraltar. Teams were initially allocated during the preliminary draw held in July 2015 in Saint Petersburg, where UEFA established the group-stage framework and match calendar for the upcoming campaign.

A notable administrative change occurred after the draw. Gibraltar became eligible to take part once it was accepted as a FIFA member in 2016, and it was subsequently placed into Group H. At the same time, UEFA managed political and security considerations connected to Kosovo’s admission by avoiding certain pairings, including keeping Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo apart in the group phase. Because Gibraltar’s inclusion increased the number of participants, the scheduling approach for the group had to be adjusted.

Group H also intersected briefly with planning for the host nation. Russia, already qualified automatically as tournament organisers, had been linked to the original five-team version of the group so that it could play friendly matches on the same international dates as Group H’s “bye” rounds. These friendlies were intended as preparation for Russia and did not influence the qualifying table. When Gibraltar was added and the group expanded to six teams, those spare dates disappeared, and the concept of coordinated friendlies was dropped.

As in other UEFA groups, each team played the others twice, once at home and once away, producing a standard double round-robin format. Results were compiled into a standings table that ranked sides primarily by points, with goal difference and other tie-breakers used when needed. The first-place team earned direct qualification to the World Cup finals. The second-place team’s route was more uncertain: runners-up were compared across groups, and the strongest of them advanced to a play-off round for the remaining European spots.

Belgium finished top of the group and secured automatic qualification. Greece ended the campaign in second position and progressed to the play-offs as one of the best runners-up, but were eliminated over two legs by Croatia, which meant Greece did not reach the finals for the first time since 2006.

The group’s matches produced a high goal total, with Belgium’s attack contributing heavily. Romelu Lukaku led the scoring charts for the group, while several other players—including Eden Hazard, Edin Džeko, and Konstantinos Mitroglou—were among the more frequent scorers. Defensive discipline also shaped squad selection: under UEFA rules, red cards and accumulated yellow cards triggered automatic suspensions, affecting availability for key fixtures and carrying over to the play-offs where applicable.",ai,informative
"Cope is an English-language surname found in many countries, especially in Britain, Ireland, North America, and parts of the former British Empire. Like many family names, it has been carried by people active in a wide range of fields, so it often appears in biographical lists and reference works.

In politics and public service, several individuals named Cope have held office or served in government roles, including members of Parliament and officials connected with British administration. The name also appears in legal and judicial contexts through judges and other civic figures. In addition, certain Cope families have been associated with local influence and long-standing involvement in regional affairs, which is why genealogical sources sometimes discuss “Cope” as more than just a single person’s surname.

The arts provide another visible group of bearers of the name. Cope has been used by poets, musicians, actors, and visual artists, spanning different periods and styles. In literature and performance, it may be encountered both as a birth surname and as a professional name.

Science and scholarship form a further category. People named Cope have contributed to disciplines such as chemistry, medicine, anatomy, classical studies, and economic research, with some becoming well known through published work or academic posts. Sports and broadcasting also include multiple Copes, from football and cricket to motor racing and rugby, as well as commentators and media personalities.

Because the surname is shared by many unrelated individuals, reference pages often provide a “see also” section linking to similar spellings or related disambiguation entries.",ai,informative
"Revenue can be artificially boosted when a company pushes more merchandise into its distribution network than the network can realistically sell to end customers. This tactic is commonly called channel stuffing, and it usually involves offering distributors or retailers unusually large shipments near the end of a quarter or year. On paper, those shipments may be recorded as “sales,” even though the products are still sitting in warehouses or on store shelves and may later be returned or heavily discounted.

The motivations vary. Senior management may be trying to meet earnings expectations, stabilize a stock price, or satisfy lenders’ performance requirements. In other cases, the pressure comes from within the sales organization: aggressive quotas and short reporting periods can encourage sales teams to prioritize immediate volume over sustainable demand. When incentives reward shipments rather than sell-through, the system can drift toward oversupplying the channel.

The longer-term impacts are often harmful. Excess inventory tends to boomerang back to the manufacturer through returns, buybacks, or special concessions. Holding and handling those unsold goods raises logistics costs and can clog warehouses. Production planning also becomes less reliable: factories may ramp up to support a surge in shipments, only to face a sudden lull in orders afterward, leading to overtime, idle capacity, or abrupt schedule changes.

Pricing can suffer as well. To persuade partners to take unwanted stock, companies frequently use steep discounts, extended payment terms, or marketing allowances. These incentives reduce margins and can distort market pricing. When too much product is floating around, it may leak into unauthorized resale channels, undermining official distributors and confusing customers about legitimate pricing.

Large retailers sometimes recognize the pattern and exploit it. By delaying routine purchases until a supplier’s reporting deadline, they can negotiate more favorable terms when the supplier is eager to “hit the number.” The next period may then start with minimal orders as the retailer works down inventory, perpetuating a cycle of spikes and slumps.

Because channel stuffing can mislead investors about true demand, regulators and auditors may scrutinize it, particularly when revenue recognition rules are stretched or when it accompanies other accounting concerns.",ai,informative
"Hawton is a village and civil parish in the western part of the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, close to the county boundary with North Yorkshire. The parish includes the neighbouring settlements of Elden and Carrfield, and in recent decades has maintained a population of a little over four thousand residents. Its northern edge follows a small river valley, while a long-established coaching route and later main road defines much of the boundary to the west. The surrounding landscape is largely flat, with wide fields, drainage ditches, and scattered woods that reflect centuries of agricultural use.

Very little is documented about Hawton before the late 11th century, when places in this region first appeared in national surveys of landholding and taxation. At that time the community would have been small, with most households tied to farming and seasonal labour. In the medieval period, a larger neighbouring village developed religious and commercial importance, gaining a church and regular trading opportunities, while Hawton remained a quieter agricultural hamlet. Local legend connects nearby woodland to outlaw stories that circulated across Yorkshire, but firm evidence for those links is limited and tends to belong more to folklore than to record.

A small religious house was later founded close to the river, taking advantage of access to water and fertile ground. Like many minor priories, it never became wealthy or politically prominent, and its buildings were eventually removed during the suppression of monastic institutions in the 16th century. Over time, the land was absorbed into private estates, and control of the manor changed hands several times. In the 18th century a notable benefactor left money for local poor relief and assigned parts of the estate to an educational foundation, an arrangement that influenced rents, repairs, and the management of parish land for generations. A substantial manor residence was constructed during this period, symbolising the estate’s authority and providing employment for local craftsmen.

Through the 19th century Hawton continued to depend on farming, but its social life expanded. Inns and beerhouses appeared along the main road to cater for travellers and labourers, and a school and chapel were added as literacy and nonconformist worship grew in the countryside. The arrival of the railway in the mid-1800s changed the village’s connections even if it did not immediately transform its economy. A small station on a branch line allowed quicker movement of people, livestock, and produce to nearby market towns.

Early in the 20th century, proposed coal mining in the wider area encouraged speculative building. Rows of red-brick terraces were erected in anticipation of new workers, and when pits opened within travelling distance, additional services—especially a larger public house—were established. After the Second World War, further housing estates gradually filled gaps between older cottages, and several historic farm buildings and the manor house were demolished, replaced by modern developments.

Today Hawton functions mainly as a residential village for commuters travelling to Doncaster, Pontefract, and other nearby centres. It retains a small selection of amenities, typically including a shop, social club, and a couple of pubs. Much of its older architectural character has been reduced, though a small number of listed features—such as a historic pump or milestone—still provide visible links to the parish’s long rural past.",ai,informative
"William, Willie, or Billy Dunn is a name shared by a wide range of people in public life, and it can refer to individuals in politics, sports, the military, academia, and the arts. Because the surname Dunn is common in the United Kingdom, Ireland, North America, and other English-speaking regions, lists of “William Dunn” often collect notable figures from different centuries and professions.

In politics and public service, several William Dunns have held elected office or civic leadership roles. Some were members of national legislatures in Britain or the United States, while others served in local government as mayors or municipal officials. A number of men named Sir William Dunn also appear in historical records, reflecting British titles such as baronetcies that were passed through families.

Sports is another area where the name appears frequently. Football (soccer) records include multiple players called William or Billy Dunn from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, some associated with well-known clubs in Britain. Other athletes include golfers—where “Willie Dunn” may refer to both players and course designers—as well as competitors in Olympic or international events in disciplines such as bobsleigh. In some cases, the same sport contains more than one notable Dunn, so birth years or team affiliations are used to distinguish them.

Beyond politics and sport, the name is linked to varied careers: industrialists involved in agriculture or milling, military figures recognized for wartime service, physicians connected to professional medical institutions, and academics working in fields such as international relations or biochemistry. The entertainment and cultural sphere includes performers and writers, and in Canada the name is also associated with a musician and filmmaker who engaged in activism and public debate.

Related entries often point readers to broader resources, such as pages for “Bill Dunn,” the general Dunn surname, or similarly spelled names like Donne.",ai,informative
"In Mende religious tradition from Sierra Leone, Ngewo is regarded as the highest creator deity and ruler of the sky. Accounts describe this supreme being as the source of the world’s existence and the power that governs major forces of nature, such as weather and other events that shape life on earth. Some explanations also note that ideas about Ngewo developed through the joining of earlier divine figures: a male creator associated with the name Ngewo and an older female divinity, Leve. In this combined understanding, Leve is often treated as Ngewo’s partner, while worship centers on the single, overarching name.

Ngewo is frequently characterized as remote. Rather than being involved in everyday problems, he is seen as dwelling above and remaining beyond ordinary human reach. Even so, stories suggest that neglect has consequences. People who fail to honor the creator through prayer or tribute may be corrected or punished, not because Ngewo is constantly present, but because proper respect is viewed as maintaining balance between humans and the divine order.

Communication between Ngewo and the community is often described as indirect. Ancestor spirits, commonly called dyinyinga, function as intermediaries who can carry concerns upward and deliver guidance downward. These spirits may also require offerings, especially food, reflecting the idea that the living and the dead remain linked through ritual exchange.

Several myths explain key features of human life. One narrative tells of a time when Ngewo lived alone on earth and, seeking companionship, made animals in pairs before shaping the first man and woman. Another tale accounts for mortality: two animals were sent with opposing messages about human destiny, but the bearer of death arrived first, fixing death as part of the human condition.",ai,informative
"TriBeCa, sometimes written as Tribeca, was an American drama anthology that premiered in 1993 on the Fox network. Developed by producer David J. Burke and made in association with TriBeCa Productions, the project also involved Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal in a producing capacity. Each installment told a self-contained story, using the TriBeCa area of lower Manhattan as a shared backdrop rather than following a single continuing plot. The program’s opening music was “Keep It Going,” performed by the alternative hip hop artist Me Phi Me.

The series became known for recruiting high-profile talent both in front of and behind the camera. Alongside regular performers such as Philip Bosco and Joe Morton, episodes featured a wide range of guest actors, including Eli Wallach, Kevin Spacey, Kathleen Quinlan, Carol Kane, Debbie Harry, and Danny Aiello III. Notable musicians also appeared, among them jazz legend Dizzy Gillespie. Creative duties were similarly varied, with scripts and direction handled by Burke and additional filmmakers and writers such as Hans Tobeason, John Mankiewicz, Barry Primus, Bryan Spicer, and Jeffrey Solomon.

Critical response highlighted the show’s ambition and the caliber of its participants. Laurence Fishburne earned a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his lead performance in the opening episode, “The Box,” where he played Martin McHenry. Even with strong reviews and award recognition, the series struggled to build an audience and was cancelled after seven episodes, concluding its only season in 1993.",ai,informative
"The Dark Side of Nowhere is a middle-grade science fiction novel by American author Neal Shusterman. Released in 1997 by Little, Brown and Company, the book is about 256 pages long and is often recommended for readers around age twelve and older. It blends familiar school-and-family settings with unsettling mystery, using a small town to explore questions about identity and belonging.

The story centers on Jason Miller, a teenager who begins the day feeling as though something is off. The problem is not simply mood or stress; his sense of self seems to have shifted, and the world around him no longer fits the life he remembers. After a sudden tragedy involving his friend Ethan, Jason notices that people in his community behave in odd, almost staged ways. Conversations feel rehearsed, reactions seem delayed, and even those closest to him appear to be hiding information. As Jason tries to understand what has changed, he becomes increasingly suspicious of the town’s routines and the “normal” life he once wanted.

As the plot develops, Jason is pushed into a transformation that forces him to confront what the town really is and what role he has been assigned within it. The novel uses science fiction elements to raise broader ideas about conformity, the pressure to fit in, and how a desire for an exciting life can lead to unexpected consequences.

The book has been recognized on several youth reading lists and award programs, including state-level selections and honors from library and young adult literature organizations in the late 1990s and early 2000s.",ai,informative
"Punk in Drublic is the fifth studio album by American punk band NOFX, issued in 1994 through Epitaph Records. Arriving after the group had already built a strong underground following, the record helped push 1990s skate punk into wider visibility. It keeps the band’s fast, abrasive approach, but it also adds more melodic hooks and tighter song structures than many of their earlier releases. Lyrically, the album mixes sarcasm, social commentary, and personal frustration, often delivered with humor that contrasts with the speed and intensity of the music.

The album’s title is a playful twist on the phrase “drunk in public,” hinting at recurring themes of substance use and misbehavior without presenting them in a celebratory way. Musically, the songs are built around quick tempo changes, choppy guitar rhythms, and busy drumming. Short tracks dominate the running time, giving the record a relentless pace, but several songs slow down just enough to highlight NOFX’s knack for melody.

Release and promotion for Punk in Drublic came at a moment when independent labels were gaining attention as punk and alternative rock reached larger audiences. The record benefited from extensive touring and word-of-mouth support in skate and college scenes. Over time it became one of Epitaph’s best-known releases and a frequent entry point for new listeners exploring 1990s punk.

Critical and fan reception has often focused on the album’s blend of technical playing and accessible choruses. Many listeners cite it as a benchmark for skate punk production in the mid-1990s: loud and energetic, but clearer and more balanced than many DIY recordings from the era. The album is also commonly referenced in discussions of punk’s shift toward broader popularity during the decade, even though NOFX remained outside the major-label system.

Track highlights include “Linoleum,” “Leave It Alone,” and “The Brews,” all of which became staples in live sets. The record’s lasting presence is also tied to its distinct sense of humor, which influenced later pop-punk and skate-punk bands looking to combine sharp commentary with catchy songwriting.

The lineup at the time featured Fat Mike on bass and vocals, El Hefe on guitar and trumpet, Eric Melvin on guitar, and Erik “Smelly” Sandin on drums. Together, they produced an album that captures a specific moment in punk history while remaining a widely recognized example of the genre’s sound.",ai,informative
"The 1969 Texas A&I Javelinas football squad represented the Texas College of Arts and Industries—today Texas A&M University–Kingsville—during the 1969 NAIA season. Competing in the Lone Star Conference, the Javelinas were led by long-time head coach Gil Steinke, who was in his 16th season guiding the program. Texas A&I produced an outstanding year, finishing 11–1 overall and 6–1 in conference play. That performance earned the team a share of the Lone Star Conference title, and it capped the season by winning the NAIA national championship after a victory in the Champion Bowl. The campaign included only one defeat.

The roster drew significant recognition from conference coaches when the All–Lone Star Conference teams were announced. Fourteen Javelinas received first- or second-team selections, reflecting strength across both offense and defense. Among the first-team honorees were defensive backs Alvin Matthews and Ed Scott, along with standouts on the line and at linebacker, including Don Hynds, Curtiss Neal, Margarito Guerrero, and Robert Young. On offense, James Respondek and linemen such as Andy Browder and Ronald Fielding were also placed on the top unit. Second-team selections included quarterback Karl Douglas, running back Henry Glenn, receiver Dwight Harrison, and center Tom Domel, among others.

Several players gained attention beyond the conference level as well. Matthews and Guerrero were named to the Associated Press Little All-America second team, while Young earned third-team recognition and Scott received honorable mention. The Javelinas played their home games at Javelina Stadium in Kingsville, Texas.",ai,informative
"The so‑called Tomb of Eve is a former burial landmark once found in Jeddah on Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea coast. Locally it was often referred to as Eve’s Grave, and popular tradition linked it to Hawwa (Eve), who in Islamic and wider Abrahamic lore is regarded as the first woman. Although no archaeological proof confirms the identification, the site became a point of curiosity for residents and travelers and, at times, a destination for visitors seeking blessing.

Descriptions of the location appear in early twentieth‑century accounts by diplomats and writers. One British consular report from 1926 provides a rare administrative reference to the monument, while other observers mention its unusual proportions. Estimates varied, but several authors described a very long, narrow tomb outline, far larger than an ordinary grave. This exaggerated scale encouraged debate: some treated it as symbolic, while others used it as evidence that the claim could not be literal.

The tomb also intersected with the city’s name and folklore. Jeddah is commonly glossed as “grandmother” in Arabic, and this meaning supported the popular idea of Eve as an ancestral figure connected to the area, even if the linguistic explanation is disputed among scholars.

Religious and political authorities eventually restricted the site. Attempts to remove or reduce the monument were reported in the late Ottoman period, and it was ultimately dismantled under Prince Faisal in 1928. Later, in 1975, remaining traces were covered with concrete to discourage devotional practices at graves, which many clerics viewed as improper. Today, the Tomb of Eve survives mainly through historical references and the continuing interest it generates in discussions of Jeddah’s heritage.",ai,informative
"Erica Jasmin Mena (born November 8, 1987) is an American reality television figure who first built public recognition through modeling work and appearances in hip hop music videos. Over time, she expanded into television and publishing, becoming a familiar face within the Love & Hip Hop franchise.

Mena’s early career was rooted in the entertainment and fashion worlds, where she worked as a model and gained attention as a “video vixen.” This label is commonly used for women featured prominently in music videos, particularly in the hip hop and R&B genres. During this period, she appeared in videos connected to well-known recording artists, which helped her develop name recognition beyond traditional modeling.

Her profile grew further when she transitioned to reality television. She appeared on shows that followed the personal and professional lives of cast members, a format that often blends behind-the-scenes access with scripted structure. Mena became best known for her role on Love & Hip Hop: New York, the first series in a long-running franchise focused on relationships and careers within the hip hop industry. She later joined Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta and also returned to Love & Hip Hop: New York for a milestone season. In addition, she participated in VH1’s Scared Famous, a competition series that combines celebrity casting with horror-themed challenges.

Outside television, Mena has also pursued writing. She released autobiographical books that present her personal experiences and public image through a confessional style, reflecting on relationships, self-perception, and life in entertainment.

In her personal life, Mena has publicly identified as bisexual and has spoken about her Latina heritage, with Puerto Rican and Dominican family roots. She attended Newburgh Free Academy in Newburgh, New York. She is a mother of three children. Her first child, a son born in 2007, is with music video director and rapper Raul Conde, associated with Fat Joe’s Terror Squad. Mena was previously engaged to performer Bow Wow. She later became engaged to rapper and TV personality Safaree Samuels in 2018; the couple married in 2019 and welcomed a daughter in 2020 and a son in 2021. In 2021, reports indicated that Mena filed for divorce from Samuels.",ai,informative
"Ditte Hansen (born 6 December 1970 in Copenhagen) is a Danish performer and writer recognized for combining acting with scripted comedy and satire. She is especially associated with the television series *Ditte & Louise*, which later expanded into a feature film, and with her work in Denmark’s long-running revue tradition.

Hansen grew up in Copenhagen in a difficult home environment marked by her father’s alcoholism. Episodes of instability and mistreatment left lasting effects, and she has spoken about seeking professional support at times to manage the impact of those experiences. In adulthood, she has described having a strong personal support system, including her relationship with her spouse.

Her professional training began at the Odense Theatre’s acting school, from which she graduated in 1996. Soon after, she worked at the theatre for several years, gaining stage experience that later informed her screen roles. She entered Danish film with a part in Hella Joof’s comedy-drama *Oh Happy Day*, and later became a familiar face in popular entertainment, including the annual *Cirkusrevyen*, where performers present sketches, songs, and political humor.

Alongside acting, Hansen has taken on high-profile hosting work within the Danish theatre world, including presenting the Reumert awards in 2010 and again in 2011. On television she has appeared in both dramatic and comedic formats, including a role as a forensic pathologist in the third season of *Forbrydelsen* (*The Killing*), as well as multiple characters in satirical programming on DR1.

From 2015 to 2018 she co-wrote and starred in *Ditte & Louise* with Louise Mieritz, producing two seasons and a film adaptation. In 2019, she added book publication to her credits with *Gode Kasser*.",ai,informative
"The 2014 edition of the Campeonato Alagoano marked the 84th running of Alagoas’s main professional football championship. Matches were played from 12 January through 30 April, with Coruripe finishing the season as champions and lifting the state title for the third time in their history. At the opposite end of the table, Penedense and Comercial-AL ended the campaign in the relegation positions.

The tournament was organized in stages. In the opening phase, eight clubs competed in a home-and-away round-robin schedule. After all teams had faced each other twice, the four best-placed sides advanced to knockout rounds, and the stage winner earned a place in the following year’s Copa do Brasil.

A second phase then expanded the field, adding CRB and CSA, who had been involved in the 2014 Copa do Nordeste. Ten teams were divided into two groups, playing for spots in the decisive rounds. The leading teams from each group progressed to semifinals and a final. This stage also distributed national berths: the top teams qualified for the next Copa do Brasil and Copa do Nordeste, while the best overall performer secured a place in the 2014 Série D of the Brazilian Championship.

One notable change before kickoff was the merger involving Corinthians Alagoano and Santa Rita, which opened a promotion place for Penedense.",ai,informative
"Benalto is a small settlement in central Alberta, Canada, administered by Red Deer County. It lies a short distance west of the Town of Sylvan Lake and is considered part of the region’s rural network of communities. For statistical reporting, Statistics Canada identifies Benalto as a “designated place,” a category used to present census data for populated areas that are not incorporated as municipalities.

Immediately beside Benalto is Kountry Meadows, a manufactured home community that is also treated as a separate designated place by Statistics Canada. While the two areas are closely connected in daily life, the official hamlet boundary for Benalto does not currently extend to include the manufactured home park.

Population figures for Benalto are reported through the national census program.

"Édouard-Montpetit station is part of the Montreal Metro system in the borough of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Quebec. Managed by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM), it serves the Blue Line and sits near the base of Mount Royal, close to major educational and medical institutions. Because the station is built into the mountainside, it is notable for its depth and its distinctive underground cavern layout.

The station uses side platforms for trains in each direction. Passenger circulation is organized around several access points: a principal entrance along boulevard Édouard-Montpetit connects directly to the fare-paid area, while additional entrances link the station to nearby streets and to pedestrian routes leading toward the university sector. Internal corridors and stairways guide riders between the ticketing level, the platforms, and connecting passageways.

As with many stations in Montreal’s network, public art is integrated into the architecture. Decorative elements and wall treatments are placed in prominent areas such as the mezzanine and along pedestrian links, reinforcing the station’s identity and providing visual reference points for passengers. Digital information displays are also installed to provide service notices, the time of upcoming trains, and other transit announcements.

The station’s name reflects its location on Édouard-Montpetit Boulevard, a key east–west corridor that borders the campus area. It functions as an important transfer point between the metro and local bus routes, making it a practical gateway for students, staff, and visitors traveling to the Université de Montréal, nearby colleges, and hospital facilities.",ai,informative
"The Primetime Emmy Award once included a category recognizing art direction for single-camera television series. Presented as part of the Creative Arts Emmy Awards, it honored the teams responsible for the visual look of a show’s environments, including sets, scenic treatments, and the overall design approach that supports storytelling. Over the decades, the name and scope of the prize shifted to reflect changes in television production and how the Academy grouped similar work.

In earlier years, the category appeared under broader titles that combined art direction with scenic design. Later, it was reshaped into awards that separated series and program types, such as dramatic productions versus other formats. By the late 1990s and into the 2000s, the single-camera focus became a defining feature, highlighting series that relied on carefully constructed locations and sets rather than multi-camera stage layouts.

In 2014, this award structure was retired and replaced by a set of production design categories organized by narrative format and length. The revised system distinguished between contemporary or fantasy narratives running an hour or more, half-hour narrative programs, and period narratives of one hour or longer. This change aimed to better compare similar kinds of productions, since a historical drama and a modern-day series often face very different design challenges.

Across its history and successor categories, certain programs accumulated multiple wins and frequent nominations, reflecting sustained recognition for consistent visual world-building. Notable repeat award recipients included period dramas and large-scale fantasy series known for detailed sets and distinctive environments. Other long-running shows earned numerous nominations, indicating steady excellence even when they did not win.

The category’s timeline spans from its mid-1950s origins through its discontinuation in 2013, after which production design awards continued under the updated classifications.",ai,informative
"The Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother are a Roman Catholic congregation of Franciscan religious women that began in the late nineteenth century and became closely associated with caring for the sick and vulnerable. Established in Rome in 1883, the group developed during a period when many new religious communities were formed to address social needs created by urban poverty, migration, and limited access to medical services.

The origins of the congregation are connected to Father Francis Mary of the Cross Jordan, who was organizing what would later be known as the Society of the Divine Savior, or Salvatorians. Seeking a women’s branch to share in this mission, he invited Amalia Streitel, a German woman with experience in religious life and education, to come to Italy and help form a new community. After arriving in Rome, she received a new religious name, Mother Frances of the Cross, and began gathering women who wanted to combine prayer with practical works of mercy.

Early conditions were modest. Housing was sparse and resources were limited, yet the small community responded to immediate local needs by taking in children without guardians and providing basic care within their own living space. As the group grew, questions arose about governance and the direction of the new institute. Within a few years, the sisters and the Salvatorians separated, and the community came under diocesan oversight in Rome. At this stage they adopted a Franciscan-inspired way of life shaped by the Rule of the Third Order Regular of Saint Francis, balancing contemplative practice with active service.

To sustain themselves and fund their charitable work, the sisters pursued practical ministries. They offered nursing services in private homes and carried out duties connected with church life, including work in a sacristy at a Roman church associated with the German-speaking community. Over time, healthcare became a central focus, both as a response to social need and as a stable form of service that matched their charism.

A significant expansion occurred when Mother Frances of the Cross traveled to the United States at the request of a bishop in Kansas to assist a struggling hospital. This initiative led to additional foundations, including hospital work in the Midwest, later developments in New Jersey, and a mission presence farther south. In 1911, the congregation received formal papal approval, marking its establishment within the wider structure of the Church.

Today, the Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother continue their mission in multiple countries across Europe, the Americas, and parts of Africa and the Caribbean, with ministries that often remain linked to healthcare and pastoral service.",ai,informative
"Karl August Theodor Lenz (12 February 1881 – 17 October 1952) was a German dramatist, lyric poet, and prose writer whose career bridged the late imperial era and the turbulent decades that followed. He was born in Bromberg, in the Prussian Province of Posen (today Bydgoszcz, Poland), and later studied literature and philosophy before turning to writing and theater administration.

Lenz published early volumes of poetry and a series of short novels that explored moral conflict, religious doubt, and social change in rapidly modernizing cities. Among his better-known titles are the novella collection Schatten am Fluss (1906) and the novel Die fremde Stunde (1912). He also wrote stage works, including the historical drama Herzogin Clara (1914) and the symbolic play Der Spiegelgarten (1920), which were staged in several German-speaking theaters.

In addition to his literary output, Lenz held influential cultural posts. During the 1920s he served as an artistic adviser at a municipal theater and later worked in radio, helping develop spoken-word programming and adaptations for early broadcasting. Like many cultural figures of his generation, he faced professional setbacks after 1933, when political pressure limited his public roles and curtailed productions of his work. After the Second World War he returned to publishing, contributing essays on theater practice and the responsibilities of writers in public life. He died in southern Germany, leaving a body of work that reflects both aesthetic experimentation and the constraints of his historical moment.",ai,informative
"Varghese Kuriakose (14 February 1901 – 3 September 1972), often remembered locally as the “Pastor of Puthenpadi,” was a Syro-Malabar Catholic priest from Kerala who became known for combining pastoral work with community development. Serving in a largely rural region where poverty and poor access to services were common, he emphasized practical assistance alongside religious instruction. In later years, his reputation for personal discipline and public service led to the opening of an ecclesiastical inquiry into his life, a preliminary step used by the Church when evaluating a person’s virtues.

Kuriakose was born in 1901 in a farming family in the Alappuzha area to Mathew and Annamma. His early education took place in local government schools, after which he continued studies at a church-run college noted for training students for public examinations. He entered seminary formation in Thrissur, where he completed philosophy and theology and was ordained a priest in the mid-1920s. Those who knew him during training described him as methodical and attentive to the everyday concerns of ordinary families.

His first significant appointment came in the early 1930s, when he was sent to Puthenpadi, a parish spread across small hamlets with limited roads and few institutions. He prioritized building stable parish structures, but his efforts were not limited to church construction. Under his leadership, the community established a primary school that later expanded to include classes for girls, a small hostel for children without reliable caregivers, and a cooperative initiative that helped families obtain seeds and basic supplies at fair prices. He also encouraged preventive health practices and arranged periodic medical visits until a permanent dispensary could be organized.

Accounts of his ministry often highlight his habit of visiting households regardless of social background and mediating local disputes without taking sides. Supporters attribute to him several favors received through prayer, which are collected as testimonies during Church investigations. A diocesan tribunal later assembled written records, witness statements, and archival material to evaluate the consistency of these reports and the broader impact of his work. Regional media and parish publications have periodically featured programs and articles revisiting his legacy and the institutions that grew from his initiatives.",ai,informative
"SkyRidge Aviation was a small Italian firm associated with the paragliding industry, known for producing paraglider wings and emergency reserve parachutes. It operated from the outskirts of Trento, after an earlier period in nearby Rovereto. Available records suggest the company was active by the early 2000s and ceased trading around 2009, during a period when several niche aviation brands struggled with rising certification costs and a tightening retail market.

The business was part of a broader holding structure called SkyRidge Sport Group, led by entrepreneur Carlo Venturi, which later appears to have dissolved. Day-to-day product development at SkyRidge Aviation was overseen by designer Luca Ferretti, who had previously worked with established canopy makers in the Alps and brought experience in pattern design, line layouts, and fabric selection. Although administrative functions remained in Italy, much of the sewing and assembly was carried out in a partner facility in Tunisia that had been set up specifically for technical textile work. This arrangement allowed the company to scale production while keeping development and testing close to European mountain sites.

SkyRidge offered a range intended to cover typical pilot progression. Entry-level wings emphasized predictable inflation and strong passive safety, while intermediate designs targeted efficient thermal climbing and better glide. At the top end, the company produced higher-performance wings for experienced pilots, along with a tandem model used by instructors and commercial operators. Product literature frequently highlighted durability, consistent trim speed, and careful quality control of stitching and line measurements.

In 2004 a prototype from the series, the Kestrel, was evaluated during a comparative demo week near Lake Garda. A reviewer noted particularly steady behavior in active air and a coherent feel on brake input, which helped build the brand’s visibility outside Italy. Near the end of its existence, SkyRidge focused on achieving European EN ratings across multiple sizes for one of its mid-level models, while an advanced wing was reportedly undergoing certification trials.

Competition participation was limited but measurable: several SkyRidge models appeared in international cross-country events and a handful of World Cup tasks during the decade, usually flown by independent pilots rather than factory teams. Known wing names associated with the company include Arco, Brio, Cirrus, Kestrel, Mira, Nova, Sirocco, and the dual-seat Duo.",ai,informative
"Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul is a documentary released in 2005 and directed by German-Turkish filmmaker Fatih Akın. The film explores Istanbul through its music, using performances and street-level encounters to show how the city’s cultural identity is shaped by many communities and traditions. Rather than focusing on a single genre, it moves across styles that coexist in contemporary Istanbul, including arabesque, rock, hip-hop, electronic music, and folk-influenced sounds.

A central figure in the documentary is Alexander Hacke, a German musician known for his work with the experimental band Einstürzende Neubauten. Hacke serves as a guide and narrator, traveling through neighborhoods, clubs, rehearsal rooms, and informal gathering places. He and Akın record musicians in varied settings, emphasizing how music emerges from everyday urban life as much as from formal stages. This approach highlights the city’s layered character, where local traditions meet global influences and older forms continue to evolve alongside newer ones.

The film received international attention and was screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 2005 outside the main competition lineup. Its soundtrack reflects the documentary’s wide range of featured artists, presenting both well-known performers and more underground acts. By placing these musicians side by side, the film suggests that Istanbul’s sound cannot be reduced to a single narrative; it is built from contrasts, collaborations, and ongoing change.

Often categorized as a music documentary as well as a portrait of Istanbul, the film is also noted for its multilingual and cross-cultural perspective. It connects German and Turkish viewpoints while documenting a city that functions as a bridge between regions, histories, and musical languages.",ai,informative

"Ronald Aspinall (26 October 1918 – 16 August 1999) was an English cricketer who represented Yorkshire and later worked as a first-class umpire. He was born in Almondbury, near Huddersfield in West Yorkshire, and developed a reputation as a dependable lower-order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler.

Aspinall’s first-class opportunities arrived relatively late. He was 27 when he debuted for Yorkshire in 1946, in the period immediately after the Second World War when county sides were rebuilding their squads. Despite a short top-level career, he produced several performances that drew attention. One standout match came in 1947 against Northamptonshire, where he dominated with the ball across both innings and played a central role in a decisive Yorkshire win.

By 1948 he was appearing more often, taking on responsibilities at the head of the attack and sharing the new ball with fellow Yorkshire bowlers. He also featured in the celebrated match against the touring Australian side of 1948, commonly associated with Don Bradman’s unbeaten team. In that fixture, Aspinall managed the notable achievement of dismissing Bradman in the second innings, along with other key Australian players.

His final season at the highest level began impressively. In early 1949 he recorded excellent bowling figures and briefly led England’s national bowling averages, taking wickets at a very low cost. However, a serious Achilles tendon injury brought his first-class playing days to an abrupt end.

After leaving county cricket, Aspinall continued in the game through Minor Counties cricket with Durham during the 1950s. From 1960 to 1981 he served as a first-class umpire, extending his involvement in professional cricket for more than two decades. He died in Almondbury in 1999 at the age of 80.",ai,informative
"Romano’s Macaroni Grill is a casual dining restaurant brand known for Italian-American dishes served in a sit-down setting. The chain operates dozens of locations across the United States and maintains corporate offices in Denver, Colorado. Its concept blends familiar American restaurant service with menu items inspired by Italian and broader Mediterranean cooking traditions.

The first Romano’s Macaroni Grill opened in 1988 in Leon Springs, Texas, an area that is now part of San Antonio. The restaurant was created by Philip J. Romano, a restaurateur whose name became closely associated with the brand’s identity. Over time, the original site changed hands and later ceased operations after a fire in 2021, leaving its future uncertain.

The company’s ownership history includes several major transactions. In 1989, Brinker International acquired franchise rights and expanded the concept significantly. By the mid-2000s, Brinker began evaluating strategic alternatives for its large portfolio of company-run restaurants. In 2008, a controlling share of the chain was purchased by Mac Acquisition LLC, tied to Golden Gate Capital, while Brinker retained a smaller minority stake for a period afterward. Another change occurred in 2013, when Ignite Restaurant Group bought the brand in an all-cash deal. Two years later, ownership shifted again when Redrock Partners acquired the business at a much lower reported price, reflecting the challenges many mid-market restaurant chains face as consumer preferences and competition evolve. In 2017, Romano’s Macaroni Grill entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a process often used by restaurant companies to restructure leases and debt while continuing to operate. In 2018, the company expanded its portfolio by purchasing Sullivan’s Steakhouse.

Macaroni Grill’s menu centers on pasta, sauces, and classic Italian-American combinations. A signature offering is a build-your-own pasta option, allowing diners to select noodles, sauce styles, and add-ons such as proteins or vegetables. Meals commonly include complimentary bread served with olive oil, aligning with familiar Italian restaurant customs in the U.S. The brand has also promoted ingredient sourcing from Italy, highlighting relationships with family-run suppliers to emphasize authenticity and traceability.

Beyond dine-in service, Macaroni Grill has extended its presence into retail through packaged food products modeled on restaurant dishes. These items have been produced through a partnership with a large consumer food manufacturer, making the brand available to customers outside its restaurant locations.

Nutrition has been a recurring topic in the chain’s public profile. In the late 2000s, media coverage criticized the high calorie counts typical of many full-service restaurant meals. Later reporting noted improvements, pointing to menu revisions and leadership initiatives aimed at reducing calories in certain entrées and presenting lighter options.",ai,informative
"Dark Days is the first full-length studio release by the American rock project Loaded. The album was put together in Seattle, Washington, during sessions that ran from late 2000 into early 2001 at Jupiter Studios. After the recording was completed, it initially appeared as an independent release in mid-2001, reaching listeners in the United States and Japan first. A wider European release followed the next year, helping the record find an audience beyond its original market.

The album’s background is closely connected to earlier songwriting efforts by frontman Duff McKagan. As the sessions took shape, he revisited several pieces that had been associated with his previous work and reworked them alongside newly written material. For the studio lineup, McKagan assembled musicians drawn from Seattle’s broader rock scene. Drummer Geoff Reading joined the project after playing in bands such as Green Apple Quick Step and New American Shame, while guitarist Dave Dederer came in with experience from The Presidents of the United States of America. Producer Martin Feveyear played a central role in shaping the sound and also contributed keyboard parts, giving certain tracks added texture beyond the core guitar-bass-drum setup.

McKagan handled bass throughout the record and also contributed additional instruments where needed. One notable detail is that he played piano on the song “Misery,” showing a willingness to broaden the album’s palette. Guitarist Mike Squires, known for work with groups including Harvey Danger and The Nevada Bachelors, was invited to add extra guitar layers, reinforcing the album’s dense, riff-driven approach.

Before release, McKagan confirmed the title Dark Days and chose to present the material under the band name Loaded rather than as a solo effort, signaling a more collaborative identity. Promotion for the album included a short run of club shows, including dates at House of Blues venues in several U.S. cities. As touring plans expanded, the lineup was adjusted to support live performances, adding players so McKagan could shift between roles onstage. Tours in the United States, Japan, and later Europe helped maintain momentum into 2002.

Years later, the album was reissued in 2008 on both CD and digital formats, with certain editions including bonus live recordings from the band’s Japan tour, offering a snapshot of how the songs evolved in concert.",ai,informative
"Berseba is an electoral constituency located in Namibia’s ǁKaras Region, with the village of Berseba serving as its administrative centre. The area includes notable natural and populated sites, such as the Brukkaros crater and small settlements including Snyfontein, Helmeringhausen, Tses, Bethanie, and Goageb. At one point the constituency recorded about 6,659 registered voters. Census figures show steady growth over time: the population rose from 9,064 in 2001 to 10,589 in 2011.

The constituency is also linked to early resource exploration in Namibia. Diamonds were first identified in this broader area in 1898, and petroleum discoveries followed in 1929, highlighting the region’s long-standing connection to mining and prospecting activity.

Political representation has changed over successive regional elections. In 2010, SWAPO candidate Dawid Boois won the council seat with 1,225 votes, ahead of several opponents from parties such as the RDP, DTA, DP, and COD. He retained the position in 2015 after increasing his vote total to 1,774.

"Parker Memorial Night is a live jazz release credited to Chicago-based multi-instrumentalist Ira Sullivan, documenting a concert performance from the early 1960s. The session was taped at a benefit-style tribute honoring alto saxophonist Charlie Parker, a central figure in the development of bebop. The recording first appeared on the Vee-Jay label as a single LP, capturing a compact set built around Parker-associated repertoire and a few well-known standards. Decades later, the album was expanded and reissued on CD, adding previously unissued selections from the same event and turning the original program into a longer snapshot of the band’s book.

Critical discussion of the reissue has often highlighted the value of the expanded track list. Reviewers note that the additional performances broaden the view of the ensemble, moving from fast bebop heads to mid-tempo blues and ballad material. The core appeal is the spontaneity of the live setting: extended solos, audible interaction between horns and rhythm section, and the way familiar themes are reshaped through improvisation.

The repertoire centers on Charlie Parker compositions, alongside tunes by writers closely connected to modern jazz and the American songbook. The expanded edition also includes pieces associated with Dizzy Gillespie and other contemporaries, reflecting the wider bebop ecosystem rather than a narrow “greatest hits” approach.

Sullivan is featured primarily on trumpet and flugelhorn, supported by a quintet with tenor saxophone, piano, bass, and drums. The personnel underscores a typical bebop frontline and rhythm section, emphasizing tight unison themes, brisk tempos, and a harmonic language rooted in rapid chord changes and melodic variation.",ai,informative
"In the early decades of motorized transport, lawmakers in several places adopted so-called “red flag” requirements for road vehicles. These rules were designed to reduce collisions and prevent horses and pedestrians from being startled by unfamiliar machines. At a time when roads were shared by walkers, carts, and livestock, even a slow-moving automobile or steam carriage could create panic, and governments treated it as a public safety issue that needed special regulation.

In Britain, a series of statutes known as the Locomotive Acts placed strict limits on the use of mechanically powered vehicles on public roads. The best-known measure, passed in the mid-1860s, required a small crew rather than a single driver and demanded that one person walk ahead of the vehicle to provide advance warning. That escort was expected to signal to other road users and to help manage encounters with horse-drawn traffic. The distance between the walker and the vehicle was set far enough to give riders and drivers time to react, and the warning could be given with a clearly visible flag by day or a lamp in low light. These restrictions reflected widespread concern that heavy, noisy machines would endanger the public and disrupt everyday travel.

A similar approach briefly appeared in the United States. In the 1890s, Vermont adopted a law aimed at steam-powered road vehicles, requiring a person to proceed ahead of the machine and alert those traveling with animals. Night travel brought an additional expectation: a red light or other clear signal to increase visibility. The rules generally focused on road-going vehicles and did not cover railways, which already operated under separate safety systems and dedicated rights-of-way.

Red flag provisions did not last long in most places. As engines improved and vehicles became more reliable and controllable, governments shifted toward other forms of regulation, such as speed limits, licensing, standardized lighting, and traffic enforcement. The brief era of red flag laws illustrates a transitional period in transport history, when societies were adapting legal frameworks to technologies that were rapidly changing how roads were used.",ai,informative
"“The Novocaine Mutiny” is a fourth-season episode of the television comedy-drama *M*A*S*H*, first broadcast in early 1976. The story is framed around a formal military inquiry, using the structure of a hearing to revisit a chaotic day in the 4077th’s operating room. Rather than unfolding in a straightforward timeline, the episode relies on testimony from different characters, allowing the audience to compare competing versions of the same event and to see how personal agendas can shape “official” narratives.

The plot centers on Captain Hawkeye Pierce, who is accused of mutiny by Major Frank Burns. The accusation is serious: under military law, mutiny can carry extreme penalties, and the threat of a court-martial hangs over Hawkeye from the outset. To decide whether the case merits a full trial, a preliminary proceeding is convened, presided over by a superior officer brought in to evaluate the evidence.

Much of the background to the charge stems from a brief period when Colonel Potter is away from camp. In his absence, Burns takes on acting command and attempts to impose strict discipline. His efforts are less about operational necessity than about control, and they disrupt the unit’s usual routines. One example is a campaign against gambling, which Burns treats as a major breach of order. When a large sum of money goes missing, he launches a broad and intrusive search across the camp, refusing to accept the more mundane explanation that the money was simply lost during a card game. The investigation becomes increasingly petty and personal, creating tension among staff who are already stretched thin by the demands of the war.

During the hearing, witnesses describe the lead-up to the operating-room confrontation. Their accounts emphasize the pressures of mass casualties, limited time, and the need for careful triage and preparation before surgery. Hawkeye’s defense rests on a professional argument: he believes Burns was pushing patients into surgery without adequate pre-operative assessment, increasing the risk of preventable deaths. Burns, by contrast, portrays himself as the only one trying to keep the unit functioning under impossible conditions, casting Hawkeye as insubordinate and reckless.

The central incident is presented in sharply different ways. Burns claims he was deliberately incapacitated so that Hawkeye could seize control. Hawkeye describes a more mundane sequence in which Burns is removed from the operating room after his decisions endanger patients, and an accidental injury contributes to Burns being knocked out. The hearing officer ultimately concludes that the evidence does not justify escalating the matter to a court-martial, treating Burns’s account with skepticism.

After the proceedings, life at the 4077th returns to its familiar rhythm. The episode closes by highlighting the gap between rigid rule-making and the informal culture that keeps the unit functioning, suggesting that survival in a field hospital often depends as much on practicality and trust as on strict adherence to authority.",ai,informative
"Antoine Wehenkel (10 February 1910 – 27 February 1992) was a Luxembourg politician with a professional background in engineering. He played a prominent role in the Luxembourg Socialist Workers’ Party (LSAP), serving as its president from 1970 to 1974. His parliamentary career began in 1951, when he entered the Chamber of Deputies, where he remained a central figure in national politics for more than two decades.

During the 1960s, Wehenkel moved from legislative work into government. In the cabinet led by Pierre Werner, he held responsibility for public finances as Minister for the Budget. He also took charge of economic policy in a period when Luxembourg was modernizing its industrial base and expanding energy planning, including in a ministry that combined national economy and energy matters. After a change in coalition in 1969 pushed the LSAP out of government, Wehenkel returned to parliamentary leadership rather than executive office.

He later became President of the Chamber of Deputies, a position that involves overseeing debates, maintaining procedural order, and representing the legislature externally. He held this post until 1974, when he left national politics. Alongside his national roles, he also served on the municipal council of Luxembourg City from 1951 to 1964.",ai,informative
"“Never Again” is a phrase best known as a moral commitment to prevent the return of genocide and mass persecution. It is closely linked to remembrance of the Holocaust, but it has also been adopted in discussions of other atrocities and human rights crises. Over time, the words have moved beyond their historical origins and become a widely used title and theme across many kinds of media and public life.

In film and television, “Never Again” appears as the name of multiple productions from different eras. Early cinema includes silent-era shorts and features that used the title for stories unrelated to modern political meanings. Later works include an independent film released in the early 2000s, as well as episodes of popular television series. When used in episodic TV, the phrase typically signals a turning point, a personal vow, or a confrontation with past trauma, even when the plot is not directly about historical genocide.

The phrase is also common in publishing. Several nonfiction books employ it to frame accounts of the Holocaust or to argue for vigilance against hatred and state violence. Other titles apply “Never Again” to national security, justice policy, or the interpretation of political periods after major conflicts. In addition, some authors use the wording for alternate-history or speculative series, where the title suggests an attempt to rewrite outcomes or prevent catastrophic events in imagined timelines. Across these works, the phrase functions as a warning, a lesson drawn from history, or a call to collective responsibility.

Music has likewise embraced “Never Again” as an album title, an EP name, and a recurring song title. Artists across rock, metal, pop, and electronic styles have used it to express regret, resolve, protest, or recovery. Because the phrase is short and emphatic, it lends itself to lyrics about breaking destructive cycles—whether in relationships, personal behavior, or broader social conditions.

Beyond entertainment and publishing, “Never Again” appears in the names of advocacy groups and public initiatives. Organizations and campaigns using the phrase often focus on fighting racism and antisemitism, promoting human rights, or responding to contemporary threats such as political discrimination or gun violence. Related expressions—such as “Lest We Forget,” “Never Forget,” and equivalents in other languages—are often grouped with “Never Again” because they share an emphasis on memory, accountability, and prevention.",ai,informative
"Secret House Against the World is a full-length studio release by Canadian hip hop artist Buck 65. Issued in 2005 through WEA, the record stands out for blending rap with elements drawn from indie rock, electronic music, and left-field pop. Several guest musicians and producers contribute to its sound, including members of Tortoise, as well as Gonzales, turntablist D-Styles, and songwriter Tim Rutili. Their involvement helps give the album a wider palette than a typical boom-bap production, with arrangements that shift between sparse beats, layered instrumentation, and more melodic passages.

Reviews from professional critics were broadly positive, though not unanimously so. On Metacritic, which aggregates published ratings into a single weighted score, the album landed in the low 70s from a modest set of reviews, a range generally associated with favorable reception. Some writers highlighted the variety of structures and textures across the track list, arguing that the constant changes keep the project engaging. Others focused on Buck 65’s delivery, noting that he sounds more comfortable matching his voice to rootsy or unconventional backdrops than on earlier releases. A few dissenting reviews described the album as challenging and emotionally distant, suggesting it may be best suited to listeners who enjoy experimental approaches to hip hop.",ai,informative
"Boneland, published in 2012, is a novel by Alan Garner that continues the story begun in his earlier books set around Alderley Edge in Cheshire. The central character is Colin, once a boy in the previous tales and now an adult who keeps to himself in a small, prefabricated shelter perched in an old quarry. Although he remains close to the landscape that shaped his childhood, his life has taken a more scientific direction: he works as an academic connected with the nearby radio astronomy facilities at Jodrell Bank.

Colin’s present is defined by a striking gap in memory. He cannot recall anything from before early adolescence, which leaves large portions of his identity inaccessible, including family connections and the extraordinary events suggested by the earlier novels. To address this, he attends psychotherapy. Much of the narrative follows the slow, often uncomfortable process of recovery, showing how fragments of recollection can surface through conversation, association, and emotional pressure rather than through simple logical deduction.

Running alongside Colin’s modern story is a second thread set in deep prehistory in the same region. A solitary person living in a cave landscape sets out from a rocky chasm to seek contact and belonging. The two storylines echo each other across time, linking personal memory with the older, shared patterns of myth and place. Garner has described his interest in the motif of the “sleeping hero,” and the book also draws meaning from an ancient stone hand axe, a tool that acts as both archaeological object and symbolic bridge between eras.",ai,informative
"The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Sorocaba is a Latin-rite ecclesiastical jurisdiction headquartered in Sorocaba, in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. It serves as a center of pastoral administration for parishes, clergy formation, and Catholic institutions in its territory, and it also leads an ecclesiastical province made up of neighboring dioceses.

The local church began on 4 July 1924, when Sorocaba was separated from surrounding jurisdictions and erected as the Diocese of Sorocaba. This reorganization reflected population growth and the need for more direct oversight of communities in the region. Decades later, on 29 April 1992, the diocese was elevated to the rank of metropolitan archdiocese, giving it additional responsibilities toward the dioceses placed under its province.

Leadership has passed through several bishops and archbishops. In the period as an archdiocese, the ordinary has been Archbishop Júlio Endi Akamine, S.A.C., in office since 28 December 2016, preceded by Archbishop Eduardo Benes de Sales Rodrigues (2005–2016) and Archbishop José Lambert Filho, C.S.S. (1992–2005). Earlier, as a diocese, it was governed by Bishop José Carlos de Aguirre (1924–1973), followed by Bishop José Melhado Campos (1973–1981) and then Bishop José Lambert Filho (1981–1992).

The archdiocese has also included coadjutor and auxiliary bishops who later received assignments elsewhere, and some priests from Sorocaba have been appointed bishops in other Brazilian dioceses. Its suffragan dioceses include Itapetininga, Itapeva, Jundiaí, and Registro.",ai,informative
"A toy soldier is a small model figure designed to resemble a military soldier. While many people think of painted plastic or metal figurines used in children’s play or in collectible displays, the phrase “toy soldier” also appears as a title or theme across a range of cultural works.

In literature, the term has been used for both poetry and fiction. It can serve as a straightforward reference to the miniature figures themselves, but it is also often employed as a metaphor for duty, conformity, or the loss of individuality. Some novels and other written works use “toy soldiers” to evoke controlled behavior or to comment on war from a domestic, everyday perspective.

Film and television have adopted the phrase in multiple ways. It has been used for action stories involving hostage situations, for dramatic narratives focused on conflict and resilience, and for documentary projects exploring real events or social issues. Individual television episodes in different series have also carried “toy soldier” as an episode title, typically to suggest characters being manipulated by larger forces or placed into rigid roles.

The name is also prominent in gaming. “Toy Soldiers” has been used for action-strategy titles that blend playful miniature aesthetics with battlefield mechanics, sometimes expanding into sequels and follow-up releases. These games often treat warfare as a tabletop-like scenario, using stylized units and accessible controls while still incorporating tactical decision-making.

In music, “Toy Soldier(s)” appears as the name of performing groups as well as the title of songs spanning pop, rock, and hip-hop. Songwriters frequently use the image to explore themes such as emotional vulnerability, being controlled by someone else, or the tension between innocence and conflict.

Related titles sometimes reference similar concepts using other terms for animated figures or miniature fighters, reinforcing the enduring appeal of the toy-soldier image in entertainment and art.",ai,informative
"Hank Jones, Ray Brown, and drummer Jimmie Smith teamed up in 1976 to record a straight-ahead jazz trio date for Concord Jazz that later appeared under the alternate title *Rockin’ in Rhythm*. Built around familiar standards, the session highlights the group’s shared sense of time and their conversational approach to melody and accompaniment. A notable feature is Jones’s decision to alternate instruments: on several tracks he moves from acoustic piano to electric piano, changing the color of the ensemble without altering its small-group format.

Critical response to the album has been mixed but generally appreciative. Reviewers often point to the trio’s tight coordination and the clarity of Jones’s phrasing, while noting that the electric piano brings a different character to his playing. Some commentary has singled out performances such as “Bags’ Groove” and “Spring Is Here” as especially effective examples of the trio’s balance between swing, restraint, and blues feeling. Other assessments have been less enthusiastic about parts of the repertoire, suggesting that the song choices are uneven compared with other releases Jones made in the same era.

The track list includes “Your Feet’s Too Big,” “My Ship,” “Alone Together,” and the Ellington-associated “Rockin’ in Rhythm,” with Jones, Brown, and Smith comprising the full personnel.",ai,informative
"Power Machines is a Russian manufacturer of equipment for the electric power industry, formed in 2000 and based in Saint Petersburg. The company specializes in large-scale machinery used in power generation, with a product range that includes steam turbines, turbine generators, and related components. Its steam turbine designs cover high-capacity units that can be applied in conventional thermal stations as well as in nuclear energy, where reliability and long service life are critical requirements. In addition to supplying domestic projects, the firm has participated in deliveries to dozens of foreign markets, and its export activity has been especially noticeable in parts of Asia.

The modern company was assembled by bringing together several long-established enterprises and design organizations in the Russian power-engineering sector. This structure reflects the way heavy electrical machinery is typically produced: different plants focus on castings and metalworking, generator manufacturing, blade production, control and testing, and engineering services. By combining these capabilities under one corporate umbrella, the company is able to develop equipment, manufacture key assemblies, and support installation and maintenance through the full life cycle of a power unit.

Changes in ownership were an important part of its early history. After the company’s creation, a controlling stake was held through an investment vehicle linked to a major Russian industrial shareholder, while a significant minority stake belonged to an international engineering group. Several years later, the foreign partner exited by selling its shares, and the company subsequently left the Russian stock exchange. A later mandatory buyout offer to remaining minority shareholders prompted public criticism from an investor advocacy organization, followed by a regulatory review and an administrative fine related to the offer process.

Power Machines’ portfolio includes different classes of turbines and turbine-generator sets, as well as gas-turbine and combined-cycle solutions developed in-house or produced under licensing arrangements. In practical terms, this means the company can supply equipment for various plant configurations, from standalone steam turbine units to modern installations that pair gas and steam turbines to improve efficiency. Alongside manufacturing, it also provides engineering support, modernization services, and spare parts—functions that are essential for utilities operating large power stations over multiple decades.",ai,informative
"Amar Dedić (born 18 August 2002) is a Bosnian professional footballer who operates mainly as a right-back. He is contracted to Red Bull Salzburg and has gained regular top-flight experience in Austria, including a loan spell with Wolfsberger AC. Dedić has also been involved with Bosnia and Herzegovina’s youth national teams, most notably at under-21 level.

Dedić’s development began in local football in Austria before he entered structured academy environments. He played for LUV Graz as a child and later joined Sturm Graz’s youth program in 2012, where he continued his training during his early teenage years. In 2015, he moved to the Red Bull Salzburg academy, a pathway known for promoting young players into professional football through its affiliated clubs.

His transition to the senior game started in 2019, when he signed his first professional terms with Salzburg. He then featured for FC Liefering, Salzburg’s feeder team competing in Austria’s second tier, which is commonly used to provide competitive minutes to emerging talents. Dedić made his senior debut in July 2019 and scored his first goal at professional level the following summer. His progress led to an extension of his Salzburg contract and opportunities in cup competition with the first team.

To accelerate his experience at the highest domestic level, Salzburg arranged a season-long loan to Wolfsberger AC in 2021. The move allowed him to play more consistently in the Austrian Bundesliga and continue his development in a demanding tactical environment.

Internationally, Dedić has represented Bosnia and Herzegovina across several youth categories and has worn the captain’s armband at under-17 level, reflecting his status within his age group.",ai,informative
"Jeremiah Antonio Lewis (March 2, 1987 – August 14, 2019), professionally known as J-Lex, was an American hip-hop artist associated with the Southern rap scene. He gained his widest recognition with the 2016 track “Run It Up,” which entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 92. Lewis was killed in a shooting in 2019.

Lewis was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and spent much of his childhood in the region before relocating to Dallas as a teenager. He frequently cited local bounce music along with mainstream rap influences such as OutKast, Lil Wayne, and The Notorious B.I.G. as shaping his approach to rhythm and storytelling. Friends and collaborators described him as focused on melodic hooks and concise, street-level narratives.

Using the name J-Lex, he began releasing mixtapes online in the early 2010s and built a following through regional radio play and live shows. His growing profile led to attention from established Southern performers and, eventually, a distribution agreement with a major label imprint in 2016. That same year, “Run It Up” became his breakthrough single, earning streaming traction and modest chart success. Music publications highlighted him as an emerging voice, and he made televised appearances performing the song to promote an accompanying mixtape.

On August 14, 2019, Lewis was shot outside a late-night diner in Baton Rouge and died at the scene at age 32. His death prompted tributes from fellow musicians and renewed interest in his recorded work.",ai,informative
"The Hapa–Bilaspur Superfast Express is a long-distance passenger train in India that links Hapa in Gujarat with Bilaspur Junction in Chhattisgarh. It is operated by the Western Railway and runs once a week in each direction under train numbers 22939 and 22940.

In terms of performance, the service covers a distance of about 1,692 kilometres. The Hapa to Bilaspur journey typically takes just over 30 hours, with an average speed close to the mid-50 km/h range. The return trip from Bilaspur to Hapa is of similar duration, with minor differences due to operational factors and scheduled stops.

The train uses conventional ICF coaches designed for a maximum speed of around 110 km/h. Its rake generally includes a mix of air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned accommodation, such as AC 2-tier and AC 3-tier coaches, sleeper class coaches, and general unreserved coaches. A combined seating-and-luggage coach arrangement is also provided to handle parcels and passenger baggage.

Traction changes along the route are a notable operational feature. A diesel locomotive typically hauls the train from Hapa to Ahmedabad. Beyond Ahmedabad, an electric locomotive takes over for the remaining run to Bilaspur, with the same pattern followed in the opposite direction.

The rake is also used for other services when not assigned to this train, helping optimize coach utilization across the network.",ai,informative
"Stampede is a black-and-white American Western released in 1949 under the direction of Lesley Selander. The film features Rod Cameron, Gale Storm, Johnny Mack Brown, and Don Castle in leading roles, with a supporting cast that includes Steve Clark, Donald Curtis, and John Miljan. Set in Arizona ranch country, the story revolves around land, water rights, and the uneasy arrival of new settlers.

The central characters are brothers Mike and Tim McCall, owners of a sizable cattle operation. To profit from unused acreage, they sell part of their range to families hoping to start farms. However, once the newcomers reach the property, they discover that the promised land lacks reliable water. The McCall ranch has blocked the local river with a dam, effectively keeping control of the area’s main supply.

John Dawson, one of the settlers, turns to the county sheriff, Aaron Ball, seeking help. The sheriff’s response is cautious and limited, reflecting the power the ranchers hold and the difficulty of enforcing a fair settlement. As tensions increase, Tim McCall grows closer to Dawson’s daughter, Connie, adding a personal conflict to the larger dispute.

With legal options failing, some settlers consider direct action, including sabotaging the dam. Retaliation threatens to escalate into violence, with plans aimed at driving the McCall herd into a destructive stampede. Like many Westerns of its era, the film uses romance and confrontation to explore authority, resources, and frontier justice.",ai,informative
"WKLF (1260 AM) is an AM radio station that airs a soft oldies music lineup by relaying programming from its sister outlet, WBRI, based in a nearby regional hub. Licensed to the town of Fairview, New York, the station targets listeners across the Riverbend area and surrounding rural communities. The facility is operated by Northfield Media Group, which also owns several signals in the region.

### Early years on 1260 AM
The 1260 frequency first became a local voice in 1961, when it signed on as WFRV with a general-interest, middle-of-the-road sound that mixed popular music, community announcements, and regular news updates. For a period, the station’s offices were housed in a downtown hotel, a common arrangement for smaller-market broadcasters that relied on central locations and walk-in access for local advertisers.

In 1967, the station adopted the call letters WLBK, reflecting new ownership and a desire to align with a larger-market station the owners admired. Like many AM outlets at the time, 1260 AM operated with a “daytimer” authorization. That meant broadcasts were limited to daylight hours to prevent interference with distant stations that could travel farther at night due to changes in the atmosphere. Each evening the transmitter went silent and resumed the next morning.

Programming shifted with audience trends. By 1973 the station moved toward a Top 40 approach, emphasizing current hits and upbeat presentation. As FM radio gained dominance for music in the late 1970s, WLBK gradually leaned into adult contemporary, keeping a broader playlist and a calmer on-air style.

### The modern station era
Following a frequency shuffle within the local market, 1260 AM went dark in 1983 and remained off the air for several years. Service returned in 1989 as WKLF, initially launching with country music and local sports coverage. In the late 1990s the station experimented with different identities, including a period when it mirrored an FM partner carrying an adult standards format. When that FM outlet later adjusted its music strategy, WKLF continued with older-leaning programming to serve longtime AM listeners.

A technical rebuild in 2012 temporarily took the station off the air while transmission equipment and an aging tower system were replaced. The upgraded facilities improved reception in outlying parts of the county and reduced interference complaints.

In 2013, WKLF switched from music to a national sports network, reflecting industry-wide interest in live events and talk programming on AM. That run lasted several years. In 2019, the station changed direction again, ending sports to begin a full-time simulcast of WBRI’s soft oldies service, bringing familiar classics and a steady presentation back to 1260 AM.",ai,informative
"Euseby Cleaver (1745–1819) was an Anglican churchman whose career linked England’s academic world with senior leadership in the Church of Ireland. He served first as Bishop of Ferns and Leighlin from 1789 to 1809 and later as Archbishop of Dublin from 1809 until his death, although his final years in office were affected by reports of serious illness.

Cleaver was born in Buckinghamshire into a clerical family. His father, the Reverend William Cleaver, operated a school at Twyford, and this background helped shape his early education. Cleaver attended Westminster School before entering Christ Church, Oxford. There he progressed through several degrees, beginning with a Bachelor of Arts in the late 1760s and later completing advanced theological qualifications that marked him as a well-trained candidate for higher church responsibilities.

Before his move to Ireland, he held parish appointments in England. In the 1770s he became rector at Spofforth in North Yorkshire. Later, with the support of an influential patron connected to his work as a tutor, he received additional livings in West Sussex, including Tillington and Petworth. Such appointments were common at the time and often depended on networks of education and patronage.

Cleaver’s episcopal career included a short period as Bishop of Cork and Ross, followed by his transfer to Ferns and Leighlin. Political unrest in Ireland deeply affected him: during the rebellion of 1798, his residence in Ferns was attacked, and he temporarily sought safety in Wales, within the ecclesiastical sphere of his brother, also a bishop.

He married Catherine Wynne of County Sligo, and they had several children. Through his daughter Caroline’s marriage to Admiral James William King, Cleaver became the grandfather of Catherine Pennefather, later known for evangelical work. Cleaver was also associated with sympathy toward the Irish language, an interest not universal among senior clergy of his era.",ai,informative
"Araucaria humboldtensis, sometimes called Humboldt’s araucaria, is a conifer belonging to the Araucariaceae family. It occurs naturally only in New Caledonia, where it is considered threatened because its remaining stands are small and widely separated. Many individuals grow in isolation rather than in continuous forests, which can limit pollination and reduce the chance that seedlings establish successfully.

This species is strongly tied to ultramafic substrates, especially serpentine-derived soils that often contain elevated concentrations of metals such as nickel and magnesium. Because these metal-rich landscapes are also targeted for extraction, habitat disturbance from mining and associated road building has been an important driver of population decline. Fire, invasive plants, and erosion on exposed slopes can further hinder regeneration after disturbance.

Mature trees can reach roughly 25–35 meters tall. The trunk is typically straight, bearing tiers of evenly spaced branches that radiate outward and then angle upward toward the tips. This architecture creates a striking, layered silhouette. Like other araucarias, it is monoecious: pollen cones and seed cones form on the same tree but in different parts of the crown. Seed cones develop slowly, remaining attached for multiple seasons until the large seeds are fully mature.

Growth is generally slow, and young plants may take years to become established, particularly on thin, rocky soils. However, the species can tolerate strong winds and periodic dry spells once rooted. Because of its symmetrical form and evergreen foliage, it has also been planted in cultivation as a decorative tree in suitable climates.",ai,informative
"Pakistan’s Parliament has maintained a dedicated body to keep the Kashmir dispute on the national agenda and to project Pakistan’s stance in external forums. Commonly referred to as the Parliamentary Special Committee on Kashmir, it is largely made up of experienced members from both houses: the National Assembly and the Senate. Beyond highlighting developments in Kashmir, the committee is also meant to coordinate positions among major political parties so that the issue is presented with continuity rather than shifting with each change of government.

During the 1990s, separate parliamentary committees were constituted at different times to pursue these aims. These panels varied in size and composition, reflecting political circumstances and parliamentary strength in each period. Leadership was typically given to a senior figure with cross-party standing, which helped the committee engage other parties and represent Parliament in public diplomacy. Over the years, notable politicians have chaired these committees, and the post has been treated as significant within Pakistan’s institutional framework.

When parliamentary activity was limited, a parallel arrangement was also used. Under President Pervez Musharraf, a National Kashmir Committee was created to sustain policy attention and public outreach. This reflected the view that Kashmir required ongoing coordination even when the legislature was not fully functioning.

In later years, a larger committee structure was formed with representation from both chambers and, at times, participation by serving ministers, indicating the overlap between parliamentary advocacy and executive policy. The chairperson has generally been accorded the rank and protocol of a federal minister. In recent times, Shehryar Khan Afridi has served as the committee’s chairman.",ai,informative
"Alain Gautier, born on 8 May 1962 in Lorient, is a French sailor recognized for his career in offshore racing. He became widely known after winning the 1992–1993 edition of the Vendée Globe, the solo, non-stop race around the world. This victory placed him among the leading figures of French ocean sailing during a period when the sport was rapidly professionalizing.

Beyond competition, Gautier has played a significant role in team preparation and technical support. In 1989 he created Lanic Sport Development, a structure focused on coaching, logistics, and performance work for offshore projects. Through this organization he has been involved in the development of several campaigns, including providing support to sailors such as Ellen MacArthur in the late 1990s and Isabelle Joschke decades later. His work reflects a broader trend in modern offshore racing, where shore-based expertise—weather analysis, boat optimization, and project management—has become almost as important as time spent at sea.

Gautier also explored the America’s Cup environment. Together with Bertrand Pacé, he helped lead the Aleph Challenge aimed at entering the 34th America’s Cup in 2013. Although the project did not secure sufficient funding to continue, the team did take part in preliminary circuits using one-design AC45 catamarans before eventually stepping back.

Over the years, Gautier’s results across major events have included stage wins and podium finishes in races such as the Solitaire du Figaro, the BOC Challenge, Route du Rhum, and Transat AG2R, as well as involvement in multihull grand prix competition. His career illustrates both the athletic demands of solo ocean racing and the long-term importance of building sustainable support structures around high-level sailing projects.",ai,informative
"Michael Hartley (born 14 February 1972) is a former Canadian track and field jumper best known for his long jump, with additional experience in the high jump and triple jump. Raised in Toronto, he developed as a versatile collegiate athlete and later represented Canada at several major international competitions during the 1990s and early 2000s.

Hartley built much of his reputation in university athletics, earning repeated all-conference and All-American recognition. While studying in the United States, he became noted for competing in multiple jumping disciplines within the same championship season, a demanding combination that requires speed, technical precision, and event-specific strength. His collegiate career included a national title in the long jump and consistent top finishes at NCAA-level meets.

Internationally, Hartley competed for Canada at global events such as the World Championships and appeared at two Summer Olympic Games. He also participated in multi-sport meets including the Commonwealth Games and Pan American Games, where his placements reflected steady competitiveness against deep international fields. Although he did not regularly medal at the senior global level, he was regarded as a reliable team member and a frequent finalist.

Across his career, Hartley’s best performances came in the late 1990s. His personal records included an outdoor long jump of 8.20 metres, a triple jump of 16.70 metres, and a high jump clearance of 2.25 metres, all achieved at major meets in North America. After retiring from competition, he remained connected to athletics through coaching and athlete development initiatives.",ai,informative
"Nepal’s Second Constituent Assembly was a single-chamber national body created to complete the constitution-writing process after the earlier assembly could not deliver a final document. Voters chose its members in the 2013 Constituent Assembly election, with the new body beginning work in early 2014. Its central mandate was to prepare and approve a constitution, while also acting as the country’s lawmaking forum during a politically transitional period. Once Nepal’s constitution was adopted in 2015, the same institution continued its functions as the Legislature-Parliament. Its term concluded in October 2017, shortly before a new parliamentary system took effect through subsequent elections.

At the start of the assembly’s life, procedural steps focused on setting leadership and getting lawmakers formally sworn in so regular business could begin. The first sitting was chaired by the senior-most member, a common parliamentary practice intended to provide a neutral presiding figure until permanent leadership arrangements are settled. In the opening days, hundreds of elected representatives took their oaths, marking the formal start of the assembly’s authority. Major political forces publicly committed themselves to a rapid constitutional timetable, presenting constitution-making as a national priority and a test of political cooperation. The membership was also notable for high turnover, with many representatives serving for the first time, which influenced both expectations and the pace of internal organization.

Forming a government was another immediate challenge. Nepal’s interim constitutional framework encouraged parties to seek broad agreement when selecting a prime minister and assembling a cabinet. The president played a facilitating role by urging parties to choose a head of government within a set period. Negotiations then unfolded among leading parties, with discussions focused on whether to create a consensus-based administration or proceed with a majority government if full participation proved impossible. Agreements were explored on issues such as power-sharing, timelines for local elections, and a one-year goal for constitution completion. While some parties supported a government led by the largest party, others preferred to remain outside the cabinet, arguing that opposition was necessary for oversight or that key political conditions had not been met. When all-party consensus could not be achieved, the leading parties shifted toward building a majority coalition under the relevant constitutional provisions.

The assembly’s work was structured through a committee system designed to divide specialized tasks and provide detailed scrutiny of policy and administration. Committees covered areas such as state administration, public spending oversight, legislation and legal reform, governance monitoring, environmental protection, international relations and labor, and sectoral issues like finance, agriculture, development, industry, and social welfare. Additional mechanisms, including hearings and special committees, supported appointments and oversight. Together, these structures helped the assembly function not only as a constitution-writing body but also as a working parliament during a crucial period in Nepal’s institutional transition.",ai,informative
"William T. Harris (February 3, 1844 – November 22, 1912) was a Union Army soldier who served in the 122nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry during the American Civil War. He enlisted in the summer of 1862 and was assigned as a private to Company D, a unit raised largely from central Illinois communities. Like many volunteers, Harris spent much of his service on garrison duty and in field operations as Union forces pushed deeper into the Gulf region late in the war.

Harris is best remembered for actions recognized with the Medal of Honor. During the Battle of Fort Blakely in Alabama on April 9, 1865, he took part in the assault on Confederate defenses and was credited with seizing an enemy flag under fire. Capturing a battle flag had both symbolic and practical importance: it could weaken an opponent’s morale, disrupt command signaling, and serve as clear evidence of a position being overrun. A number of medals were issued for similar acts at Fort Blakely, reflecting the intensity of the fighting and the prominence of the objective.

After the war, Harris was discharged in mid-1865. He later settled in Kansas, where he died in 1912 and was buried in a local cemetery.",ai,informative
"David W. Blight (born 1949) is an American historian and writer known for his work on the Civil War era, the struggle over national memory, and the history of slavery and emancipation. His scholarship has helped shape how general readers and students understand the long aftermath of the war, especially the ways Americans debated what the conflict meant and how it should be remembered.

Blight was born in Flint, Michigan, and grew up in a working-class family. He completed undergraduate study at Michigan State University, then pursued graduate training in history at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he earned his doctorate. After teaching appointments early in his career, he joined Yale University, where he became a professor of American history and developed courses on the Civil War and Reconstruction. In addition to classroom teaching, he has often contributed to public history through lectures, interviews, and documentary projects, aiming to connect academic research to broader civic conversations.

A central theme in Blight’s work is the idea that historical events do not end when the fighting stops; instead, societies continue to contest their meaning for generations. He is particularly associated with the study of “memory,” a field that examines how monuments, anniversaries, schoolbooks, and political speeches shape public understanding of the past. Blight has argued that reconciliation between white Northerners and white Southerners after the Civil War often came at the expense of Black rights and a frank reckoning with slavery’s legacy. This approach links political history to cultural history, showing how narratives about heroism and unity can obscure the experiences of formerly enslaved people.

Among his most widely discussed books is *Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory* (2001), which traces competing postwar interpretations of the conflict and explains how certain stories became dominant in national culture. The book received major recognition, including the Bancroft Prize. Blight has also written *Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom* (2018), a large-scale biography that draws on decades of research into abolitionist politics, Black intellectual life, and the changing meaning of citizenship in the nineteenth century. That biography won the Pulitzer Prize for History and was praised for presenting Douglass as both a moral critic and a strategic political actor.

Blight’s published work includes edited volumes and essay collections as well, reflecting his interest in bringing primary sources and scholarly debates to a wider audience. Across his career, he has remained focused on how the United States narrates its own past—and how those narratives influence contemporary struggles over race, rights, and national identity.",ai,informative
"Martín Gabriel Soria (born 7 August 1979 in Rosario, Argentina) is an Argentine tango dancer and instructor known for combining stage experience with detailed teaching. He began studying movement as a child, first through local folk dances and later through tango, which became his main focus during adolescence. By his late teens he was already performing in theater productions in Buenos Aires, where he gained practical experience in choreography, musical interpretation, and partner work.

Soria’s professional visibility grew after appearing as a featured dancer in a late-1990s film project centered on Argentine dance culture. He later worked for several years as an assistant to a prominent tango director, an apprenticeship that shaped his view of tango as a disciplined performing art with a distinct vocabulary rather than only a social dance. Since 2001 he has partnered with dancer and teacher Lucía Ferrer; together they have presented workshops and performances at international tango events.

Their touring schedule has taken them across Europe, North America, and parts of Asia, with frequent invitations to festivals and academies that emphasize both technique and musicality. In 2008 Soria received an honorary recognition from a Buenos Aires tango institution for his contributions as a traveling educator. Along with Ferrer, he developed a stage piece based on the music of Astor Piazzolla and collaborated with other contemporary tango artists on a production that explored modern interpretations of traditional steps.

He has also been interviewed for a documentary about tango pedagogy and performance practice. In recent years, Soria has been based in Berlin, where he teaches regular classes and seminars. In 2012 he and Ferrer helped establish an online program designed to make structured tango training accessible to students worldwide.",ai,informative
"Riverside Trader was one of a small group of British cargo steamers operated by a regional shipping firm that ran regular freight routes between western England and ports in eastern Canada and the United States during the interwar years. Launched soon after the First World War, ships of this type helped rebuild commercial links by carrying mixed cargoes such as manufactured goods, timber, grain, and general stores.

The vessel was constructed in 1921 at a shipyard on the River Avon. Like many merchant ships of the period, she had a steel hull and was powered by a triple-expansion steam engine. This reliable machinery drove a single propeller and provided a modest service speed of about 10 knots, which suited scheduled cargo work rather than fast passenger traffic. The layout typically included several holds, a central engine room, and deck cranes or derricks for loading in ports without modern facilities.

In peacetime, Riverside Trader followed established Atlantic lanes and worked as part of a wider fleet that connected provincial British ports with North American markets. When the Second World War began, merchant shipping was quickly drawn into the conflict. The ship was requisitioned for wartime service, sailed under blackout conditions, and was fitted with basic defensive equipment. After sustaining minor damage during an air raid while berthed in 1941, she returned to duty following repairs.

By 1943, the Battle of the Atlantic had intensified, and slow cargo steamers increasingly traveled in escorted convoys to reduce losses. In early May that year, Riverside Trader joined an outward-bound convoy heading toward Newfoundland. During a night attack by German submarines, she was struck by a torpedo and sank in heavy seas. Several crew members were lost, while survivors were recovered by an escort vessel and later landed safely in St. John’s.",ai,informative
"A new World Bank assessment says the Palestinian economy remains far below its productive capacity, warning that a brief improvement in employment last year has given way to renewed job losses amid continuing restrictions on movement. The report estimates overall unemployment at about 25%, more than double the level recorded before the outbreak of the uprising against Israeli occupation several years ago, with younger workers facing the most severe pressures. Joblessness among people in their late teens and early twenties is placed at roughly 37%, compared with about 14% prior to the conflict, the Bank said. During a period of reduced violence and fewer disruptions in 2003, employers added around 104,000 positions and output expanded by an estimated 6%. That rebound, however, proved fragile: in the first six months of the current year the economy shed more than 22,000 jobs, eroding earlier gains.

The report links the downturn to a rise in closures affecting crossings and travel between Palestinian towns, measures imposed by Israel that limit the movement of workers and goods and raise costs for trade and production. “The frequency and scope of closures strongly influence economic activity across the West Bank,” the Bank’s representative for the West Bank and Gaza said, arguing that unpredictable access has discouraged investment and disrupted commerce.

Nearly half of Palestinians—around 47%—are living in poverty, the report adds, leaving households highly exposed to further shocks. It notes that international assistance averaging about $950 million annually has helped soften the impact, including support for temporary employment programmes. The Bank urged the Palestinian Authority to reinvigorate institutional reforms and keep public finances under control to improve confidence among investors. The findings were released as senior US officials visited the West Bank to underline support for orderly preparations ahead of elections expected in January.",ai,news
"Grammy-winning rapper and entrepreneur Kendrick Lamar is set to move into a major executive role after being named head of creative strategy at hip-hop label Top Dawg Entertainment, the company announced on Thursday. Lamar, who has frequently spoken about focusing more on long-term projects beyond recording, will assume the post at the start of the new year, overseeing artist development and new signings while continuing to release music through his own imprint. The appointment follows a broader restructuring at Top Dawg, which recently finalized a deal that consolidates ownership and expands its distribution partnership with a major music group.

Top Dawg’s roster includes chart regulars such as SZA, Schoolboy Q and Jay Rock, and the label has built a reputation over the past decade for developing artists into mainstream successes without abandoning its West Coast roots. In a statement, Top Dawg founder Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith said Lamar’s promotion reflects “a commitment to keeping the company led by people who understand the culture and the craft,” adding that the label aims to “open a new chapter” with a stronger global footprint.

Lamar, whose real name is Kendrick Duckworth, said he viewed the role as a way to create opportunities for emerging performers. “This is about building systems that let artists own their voices and their futures,” he said, calling the job “a responsibility to the next generation.”

Lamar has released multiple platinum albums and has been recognized for work that blends commercial appeal with socially focused storytelling. While he has hinted at stepping back from constant touring, his team confirmed he will remain active as a recording artist even as he takes on expanded responsibilities behind the scenes.",ai,news
"A former senior executive linked to ex-Yukos chief Mikhail Khodorkovsky has told a Moscow court that the accusations against him are unfounded, rejecting claims of fraud and tax violations as lacking any credible legal basis. Platon Lebedev, a longtime business partner of Mr Khodorkovsky, has been appearing alongside him since hearings began in June in a case focused on the disputed acquisition of a fertiliser company during Russia’s privatisation era. 

Speaking at the start of his defence, Mr Lebedev said the prosecution’s narrative was internally inconsistent and relied on a reading of corporate transactions that he said did not match the documents in the case. He told the court he had struggled to understand how routine commercial decisions had been reframed as criminal conduct, adding that the allegations did not meet the standards required for conviction. Mr Lebedev previously ran Menatep, the holding group that once controlled Yukos.

The two defendants, who each face the possibility of a lengthy prison term if found guilty, are expected to answer a judge’s questions in the coming days as the court continues to examine evidence and witness statements. Mr Khodorkovsky, who began giving evidence last week, has denied wrongdoing and argued that the proceedings punish entrepreneurship rather than any genuine offence.

Supporters of the men have repeatedly described the case as politically driven, claiming it reflects a broader effort by the Kremlin under President Vladimir Putin to curb the influence of wealthy businessmen who rose to prominence in the 1990s. Yukos has been hit with multi-billion-dollar back-tax claims, and its key production unit was sold at auction as part of the state’s attempt to recover the alleged debt. Efforts by the company to seek protection through US courts to challenge the sale have also failed.",ai,news
"French actress Marion Cotillard has been cast as the female lead in the forthcoming film version of the best-selling thriller “The Alchemist’s Cipher,” according to several entertainment outlets. The adaptation, based on the novel by American writer Lucas Meyer, will be directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Steven Soderbergh and will co-star Matt Damon as a Harvard symbologist drawn into an international puzzle. Cotillard is expected to play Damon’s skeptical partner, a Paris-based historian whose expertise becomes central to decoding a series of clues scattered across Europe’s major museums. 

Cotillard, who most recently appeared in the drama “Winter Streets,” rose to global prominence with her performance in “La Vie en Rose” and has since balanced French productions with major English-language roles. Reports said Soderbergh favored a French performer for authenticity rather than casting a high-profile Hollywood name. In recent months, British actress Emily Blunt and French stars Léa Seydoux and Eva Green were among those speculated to be in contention for the part. 

The novel has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide and follows a conspiracy narrative linked to medieval religious lore. Producers have reportedly secured permission to shoot key scenes at the Musée d’Orsay, a location featured early in the story. The project is backed by Universal Pictures and is slated for a summer 2027 release.",ai,news
"Actress Naomi Hartley has obtained interim restraining orders against two freelance photographers after telling a Sydney court she no longer feels safe leaving her waterfront home. The orders were granted on Friday at Downing Centre Local Court following claims that a small recording device was discovered near the front gate of the property earlier this week, prompting Hartley to contact police. Lawyers representing the photographers, identified in court as Liam O’Connor and Marcus Reid, rejected any suggestion their clients were responsible for placing the device and said they would contest the matter when it returns to court.

Hartley, an Australian-born actor currently in the city to shoot the drama “Harbour Lights” alongside actor Daniel Price, sought the orders after an alleged incident on the weekend in which her vehicle was followed at speed through inner-city streets. Court documents described a pursuit in which cars ran amber and red lights and briefly crossed into oncoming lanes. Defence counsel said their clients were not involved and argued that the allegations were based on assumptions rather than identification.

The application was made under an apprehended violence order framework, typically used for cases involving threats, stalking or intimidation. In a statement read outside court, Hartley’s representative said the actor understands public interest comes with her profession and does not object to routine coverage. “But there is a line between lawful news gathering and conduct that makes someone fear for their personal safety,” the statement said.

Magistrate Karen Hsu, granting the interim protections, told the court that media workers have a right to earn a living but must operate within legal boundaries. She said the alleged driving behaviour, if proven, raised serious safety concerns for the public as well as the applicant. The interim orders restrict the photographers from approaching Hartley or coming within a specified distance of her residence until the next hearing.",ai,news
"French actress Marion Cotillard is set to take the main female role in the upcoming screen version of bestselling thriller The Silent Cipher, according to entertainment reports. The adaptation of author Liam Hart’s novel will be directed by David Fincher and will also star Matt Damon in the role of a Harvard-trained symbologist drawn into an international mystery. Cotillard is expected to play Damon’s sharp-witted collaborator, a Paris-based archivist whose expertise helps unravel a series of encrypted clues, several newspapers said.

Cotillard, who recently appeared in the drama The Last Winter Road, has built an international profile through a mix of French productions and English-language films. She rose to wider recognition after her breakthrough in La Vie en Rose and has since worked with a range of high-profile directors across Europe and the United States.

Industry outlets said the filmmakers opted for a French lead rather than casting a more established Hollywood name. In recent weeks, speculation had linked the part to names including Emily Blunt, Eva Green and Léa Seydoux.

Hart’s novel has sold more than 12 million copies worldwide and follows an alleged cover-up connected to medieval relics and secret societies. The story opens with a murder in a major Paris museum, and reports indicate the production has secured permission to film on location there. The project, backed by Paramount Pictures, carries a budget reported to exceed $90 million and is slated for release in early 2027.",ai,news
"Director George Lucas has warned that the final instalment of his Star Wars saga could be too intense for very young viewers, saying the upcoming film will push the series into darker territory than audiences have previously seen. In an interview with the US television programme 60 Minutes, Lucas said he would hesitate to bring a child aged five or six to see Star Wars: Episode III, describing it as the most violent and emotionally heavy chapter of the franchise. He added that he expects the movie to receive a US PG-13 classification, a rating that advises parental caution for children under 13 and is broadly comparable to the UK’s 12A certificate. The earlier five Star Wars releases were given the less restrictive PG rating in the United States, while British censors have largely judged them suitable for general audiences, with only Attack of the Clones receiving a PG. The new film, due to open in Britain and America on 19 May, follows the fall of Jedi knight Anakin Skywalker and his progression into Darth Vader, culminating in a climactic confrontation set against a landscape of fire, ash and flowing lava. Lucas said the story is designed as a tragic turning point for the character, focusing on moral compromise and the cost of power.",ai,news
"Telecoms gear supplier Celestel Systems has cut its previously announced profit for the 2023 financial year after completing a delayed review of its accounts. In regulatory documents filed on Monday, the Toronto-based company said net income came in at $512m, down from the $781m it had reported earlier, citing adjustments tied to revenue recognition and reserves. Despite the lower earnings figure, Celestel said full-year sales were revised up by about 3% from the preliminary total, reflecting updated contract data and improved visibility into customer returns. The company’s shares, which have fallen roughly 45% over the past 12 months, rose 1.2% in afternoon trading following the filing.

The restatement follows an internal investigation launched last year that led to the departure of chief executive Mark Reilly and the suspension of two finance executives. Celestel said securities regulators in Canada and the United States continue to review the matter, and the company is cooperating with requests for information. It also reissued results for 2021 and 2022, noting that prior statements had not fully captured certain charges related to restructuring and long-term project costs.

“With these revisions now behind us, we can focus on execution and rebuilding confidence,” newly appointed chief executive Laura Chen said. Celestel added that a group of senior leaders has agreed to return cash incentives granted for 2023, totaling $9.1m, even though the company said they were not directly responsible for the accounting changes.",ai,news
"Wales hooker Mefin Davies is expected to remain at Gloucester despite fresh speculation linking him with a return to the Neath-Swansea Ospreys. Sources close to the situation say the Welsh region has sounded out the 32-year-old following his impressive display in Saturday’s Six Nations victory over England, but Davies is understood to be settled at Kingsholm and keen to extend his stay in the Premiership. The former Celtic Warriors player is currently tied to Gloucester on a short-term agreement, yet club officials are believed to be preparing discussions over a longer contract after a run of consistent performances. Davies’ move to England came after the collapse of the Warriors left several players without a regional deal, prompting him to take a part-time arrangement with Neath to maintain fitness and match sharpness. He later featured for the Ospreys with the backing of the Wales coaching staff, though he previously voiced frustration at the lack of support during the uncertain summer. Davies also considered an offer abroad before opting to keep his international prospects alive in England.",ai,news
"Prime Minister James Harrington is expected to set 12 May as the date for the next general election when Parliament reconvenes after the spring recess, according to the network’s chief political correspondent. The correspondent said Mr Harrington is likely to travel to Buckingham Palace in early April to request a dissolution, clearing the way for a campaign beginning almost immediately. The prime minister has so far avoided confirming a timetable, despite growing pressure from opposition leaders and intensified activity by all major parties in recent days.

Downing Street declined to comment on the reported schedule, insisting that the decision rests solely with the prime minister. A No 10 spokesperson said only that an announcement would be made “in due course” and would not be drawn on specific dates.

If the dissolution is sought at the start of April, Westminster would face a compressed final week of business as ministers attempt to complete priority legislation before MPs are sent back to their constituencies. Government whips are understood to be focusing on securing passage of the Finance Bill implementing the Budget measures, which must be enacted before the end of the session. Officials are also seeking to finalise the Public Safety and Serious Crime Bill and a long-delayed Digital Identity proposal, both of which have faced lengthy scrutiny in the Lords.

Speaking on the morning programme, the correspondent said there was “a broad expectation across the Commons” that the election would be called as soon as MPs return. While the administration is not required to go to the country until next year under the five-year limit, recent governments have often opted to seek a fresh mandate after about four years in office.",ai,news
"A prominent retirement research group has warned that Britain’s pension arrangements are failing to deliver clear and adequate support, arguing that the current framework is hard for savers to understand and leaves gaps for many people. The institute said a simplified state benefit, linked to years of lawful residence rather than National Insurance records, could make entitlements more transparent and narrow disparities between those with stable careers and those with time out of work. It suggested that people with interrupted employment—such as carers and workers on irregular contracts—are more likely to miss out under contribution-based rules. The comments follow the release of an interim review by an independent pensions panel examining long-term retirement funding. That review estimates millions of employees are building up insufficient resources for later life, raising the risk of lower living standards in old age. It said closing the shortfall would likely require a mix of greater individual saving, higher public funding and/or people working longer on average.",ai,news
"Australian carrier Qantas said it delivered its strongest first-half result on record after a renewed focus on trimming expenses and improving aircraft utilisation, but cautioned that momentum is likely to ease in the months ahead. The airline reported net profit of A$462m for the six months to 31 December, up 26% from the same period a year earlier and slightly ahead of market expectations of about A$440m. Despite the upbeat headline figure, shares slipped more than 2% in early trading as management signalled softer conditions in the second half.

Executives said revenue would be weighed down by weaker leisure demand following the Indian Ocean tsunami, which disrupted travel plans across parts of Asia and diverted bookings away from affected resort destinations. Chief executive Geoff Dixon said the company had seen an immediate shift in passenger behaviour, with a notable pullback in inbound travel from Japan and a rise in short-notice cancellations. Qantas estimated the impact would shave at least A$30m from sales, though it added that demand for some domestic routes had held up.

The airline also pointed to rising jet fuel prices as a growing headwind. Chief financial officer Peter Gregg said Qantas had benefited from a stronger fuel-hedging position earlier in the year, but that protection would be less pronounced in the second half, increasing exposure to market prices.

Competitive pressures are also intensifying. Qantas continues to face aggressive discounting from low-cost rival Virgin Blue, while government discussions about granting Singapore Airlines additional rights on trans-Pacific services could put pressure on one of Qantas’s most profitable corridors. Still, the company maintained guidance for higher full-year earnings, with analysts projecting profit of roughly A$720m. Qantas said it had already banked A$245m in cost reductions and remained on track to exceed its A$500m annual savings goal, even as it reviews longer-term staffing and outsourcing options.",ai,news
"Sir Richard Ellison, the Conservative MP whose low-key leadership bid against Prime Minister Harold Bennett in 1992 helped expose divisions inside the party, has died at the age of 86. His family said he passed away on Tuesday at his home in Surrey after a prolonged illness. Though Ellison never expected to win, his challenge was widely viewed as a “marker” that emboldened senior figures to consider a full contest later that year, a sequence that ultimately contributed to Bennett’s resignation and the rise of William Harcourt after a subsequent ballot. Ellison later faced a backlash at constituency level and was not reselected ahead of the 1997 general election, bringing to an end a parliamentary career spanning more than two decades. Born in October 1938, he was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge. After national service with the Grenadier Guards, he worked in the diplomatic service, focusing on European policy, before entering politics. He first won the marginal seat of Westford in 1974 by fewer than 50 votes, lost it at the next election, and returned to the Commons in 1979. Colleagues said his independence and willingness to dissent limited his prospects of ministerial office.",ai,news
"Former Aston Villa manager Martin O’Neill has ruled himself out of the running to take over at Birmingham City, despite being identified as a leading candidate by the club’s board. The Northern Irishman, who previously worked across the city at Villa Park, said the role was appealing in most respects but would be difficult to accept given his recent history in the area. O’Neill was approached earlier this week by Birmingham’s chief executive following the departure of head coach Mark Hughes, who left St Andrew’s to join fellow Championship side West Bromwich Albion.  

Speaking to local radio, O’Neill noted that the job offered strong foundations, including a well-supported stadium, an established training base and a squad he believes has the potential to challenge higher up the table. However, he added that taking charge of a direct rival so soon after his last spell in the region could create unnecessary complications.  

Birmingham have been placed under interim leadership since Hughes’ exit, with first-team matters currently handled by assistant coach Gary Rowett and academy director Steve Spooner. The caretaker pairing oversaw a four-match unbeaten run before Saturday’s 2-1 loss to promotion contenders Leeds United, leaving the club 13th in the standings. O’Neill has been out of management since stepping down last spring, having previously held posts at Sunderland, Celtic and Leicester City.",ai,news
"UK borrowing costs are expected to stay unchanged at 4.75% after the Bank of England’s latest policy meeting, as officials weigh easing momentum against persistent inflation risks. The Monetary Policy Committee has raised rates five times over the past 12 months, but has paused since September as recent data suggest the economy is losing some pace. Output growth moderated in the last quarter, with factory activity weakening and surveys pointing to a dip in household sentiment. Economists also say the housing market, which had been a key driver of domestic demand, is showing clearer signs of cooling. Nationwide reported that average house prices slipped 0.4% in October, the sharpest monthly decline since early 2001, adding to evidence of softer conditions for buyers and sellers. Bank governor Mervyn King last month described the economy as moving through a “softer patch” after a strong start to 2004, a view echoed by market analysts who see little urgency for tighter policy this month. Richard Jeffrey, chief economist at Bridgewell Securities, said the recent run of weaker indicators makes another immediate rise unlikely, though he cautioned that the current lull may not last. “It would be a mistake to assume the peak is in,” he said, adding that further increases remain possible if demand firms.",ai,news
"The dark comedy-drama The Last Detour emerged as the standout at this year’s Independent Spirit Awards, taking home every prize it was in contention for, including best feature. Director Lena Hart accepted trophies for both directing and original screenplay, sharing the writing honor with collaborator Miles Kwon. The film’s cast was also recognized, with lead actor Daniel Reyes winning best male performance, co-star Maren Elliott earning best supporting performance, and character actor Saul Benitez taking an ensemble-related acting prize. With multiple Academy Award nominations already secured, The Last Detour is widely viewed as a strong contender ahead of Sunday’s Oscars, which the Spirit Awards traditionally precede.

Elsewhere in the ceremony, newcomer Isla Torres won best female performance for her portrayal of a migrant worker in the border-set drama Dust Country, a film that also earned its writer-director, Priya Nair, the award for best first screenplay. Comedian-turned-filmmaker Jordan Pike collected best first feature for the semi-autobiographical indie Upstate, which he also wrote and starred in. The foreign-language prize went to the Romanian period piece The Orchard’s Silence, while the documentary award was claimed by Freight Train Nation, an observational look at the modern supply chain. Rising performer Mateo Rivas received the debut performance honor for his role in the coming-of-age road film Northbound.

The winners were selected by the membership of Film Independent, a voting body made up of industry professionals across acting, directing, writing and production. Last year’s top Spirit Awards winner later translated that momentum into an Oscar victory in the screenplay category.",ai,news
"Arsenal midfielder Gilberto Silva has offered an account of the heated moments that unfolded after the Gunners’ recent defeat to Manchester United, confirming that emotions ran high in the immediate aftermath of the final whistle. Speaking to reporters, the Brazilian said the scene in the tunnel area was tense, with players and staff needing to be separated as tempers threatened to boil over. “There was a lot of shouting and pointing, and people trying to get in each other’s faces,” he said, while adding that he could not confirm suggestions that objects were thrown toward United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. “I didn’t see any food or drink being aimed at anyone,” Silva noted.

Silva sought to put the confrontation into context, arguing that post-match flare-ups are not uncommon in high-stakes fixtures. He said he had experienced more volatile occasions during derby matches in Brazil, though he acknowledged the rivalry between the clubs adds an extra edge.

However, Silva was critical of the intensity of several United challenges during the match, pointing in particular to tackles on winger José Antonio Reyes. He claimed Arsenal’s approach had been more disciplined and suggested at least one challenge warranted stronger punishment from the referee.

The Football Association said it is gathering reports on the tunnel incident and will review match officials’ submissions. Separate disciplinary action is also being considered following allegations of serious foul play, while Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger has been asked to clarify remarks made after the contest.",ai,news
"Premier League officials are working to arrange a date for a hearing into claims that Chelsea improperly contacted Arsenal defender Ashley Cole. The league has indicated that both clubs will be invited to present their accounts before an independent commission, though no firm timetable has been set for when the session will take place. A league representative said discussions are continuing to identify a suitable window, noting that the process is not tied to a strict response period.

The matter centres on reports that Cole met Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho and chief executive Peter Kenyon at a London hotel earlier this month. If such talks took place without Arsenal’s permission, they could constitute a breach of the league’s regulations governing approaches to contracted players. Chelsea have not issued a detailed public statement addressing the alleged meeting, while Arsenal have formally requested that the league examine what they describe as an unauthorised attempt to lure the England international away.

Both sides have signalled they will co-operate with the inquiry, which is expected to be handled in a single sitting rather than as a prolonged investigation. Any findings could lead to sanctions if wrongdoing is established, although the league has not indicated what outcomes it is considering.

Cole’s club future remains under scrutiny as he continues discussions with Arsenal over a new contract. His current agreement is set to run until 2007, and negotiations are understood to be ongoing. Within the Arsenal dressing room, teammates have publicly encouraged him to remain, with Robert Pires highlighting the left-back’s long association with the club and his suitability to the team’s attacking style. Pires also acknowledged that, ultimately, the decision rests with the player.",ai,news
"Sir Paul McCartney took the stage in Berlin on Saturday night for a one-off benefit concert aimed at supporting communities hit by last month’s earthquake in southern Turkey and northern Syria. The former Beatle played to a crowd of about 2,500 at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden, in an event organisers said was designed both to raise funds and to showcase a wider range of contemporary performances at the historic opera house. Proceeds will be directed to the humanitarian group Kinderhilfe Europa, which plans to help reopen a damaged school and provide temporary learning spaces for displaced children.

McCartney delivered a set drawing on decades of material, mixing well-known chart favourites with quieter ballads, accompanied on piano and acoustic guitar, and backed by a small ensemble. The performance ran for nearly three hours and proceeded without an intermission, with the audience repeatedly rising to applaud between songs.

Among those attending were former German president Joachim Gauck and several members of Berlin’s cultural community, as well as visiting diplomats. Speaking briefly from the stage, McCartney reflected on his long career and said the evening was intended to “turn attention into practical help” for families struggling to rebuild.

Separately, organisers said a charity single is being prepared featuring McCartney and singer Adele on a new recording of a classic pop standard, with an announcement on its release expected in the coming weeks.",ai,news
"Organisers of the US Vibe Awards said the ceremony will return next year, despite a knife attack that disrupted this month’s event in Santa Monica. Vibe magazine president Kenard Gibbs called the incident “disturbing” and said cancelling the awards would undermine the publication’s long-standing efforts to spotlight hip-hop artists and industry achievements. The violence broke out moments before producer and rapper Dr Dre was set to accept a lifetime honour, when a man from the audience moved toward the stage area and struck the performer, witnesses said. Police allege that rapper Young Buck then stabbed the man during the chaos that followed, as security tried to separate those involved. Young Buck, whose legal name is David Darnell Brown, has been arrested and charged with attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon, and is scheduled to appear in court on 20 December. Brown is affiliated with 50 Cent’s G-Unit collective, which has ties to Dr Dre’s record label.

"Shares in Mizuho Financial Group and Nomura Holdings advanced on Thursday after market talk suggested the two Japanese financial heavyweights are exploring a broad tie-up that could include a merger. The business daily Asahi Shimbun reported that senior executives from both groups have recently exchanged views on deeper cooperation and have sounded out regulators about potential obstacles, citing people familiar with the matter. Both companies issued statements saying no formal decision had been made, while acknowledging ongoing discussions on joint initiatives in areas such as asset management and retail investment products.

Mizuho shares rose 2.1% to 2,435 yen in Tokyo trading, while Nomura gained 4.6% to 922 yen. A combination of the country’s second-largest banking group by assets and its biggest brokerage would create one of Japan’s largest financial conglomerates, with consolidated assets that analysts estimate would exceed $1 trillion, depending on the structure.

Mizuho President Masahiro Kihara said the industry faces “intensifying competition and structural change,” adding that partnerships could help improve profitability and broaden customer offerings. Nomura said it continues to evaluate collaborations that “enhance client value,” but stressed it is not currently in active talks to integrate the businesses.

Analysts noted that pressure from low interest rates and rising compliance costs is pushing firms toward scale, and that deregulation has made it easier to sell banking and investment services side by side.",ai,news
"Singer and songwriter Jamie Carver is expected to spend the weekend in custody after failing to lodge £150,000 in surety required to secure his release on bail by the court’s deadline. Carver, 26, was granted conditional bail at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court on charges of robbery and blackmail, but his solicitor told the court the funds could not be assembled in time. The performer was arrested following an alleged incident at a London hotel on Wednesday night. A second defendant, musician Daniel Reeves, 24, from north London, appeared alongside him and faces the same allegations.

Magistrates imposed strict restrictions on Carver, including a nightly curfew from 10pm to 7am, with an exemption permitting attendance at a drug treatment programme. The court ordered that he must not leave his address unless accompanied by a private security provider, must hand over his passport, and must report to a local police station each day. Reeves was also placed under a curfew and required to surrender travel documents.

Police were called to the hotel in Islington after reports of an assault. A man in his 30s was taken to University College Hospital with facial injuries and was later discharged, officers said. Speaking outside court, a lawyer for both defendants said they “categorically deny” the accusations and will contest the case.

"Four-time Olympic gold medallist Michael Johnson has questioned whether Britain’s leading sprinters are aiming high enough, saying domestic rivalries have too often taken precedence over global success. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, the former 200m and 400m world record holder argued that the primary goal for many athletes appears to be topping the national rankings, rather than consistently challenging the world’s best at major championships. He said sprinting is ultimately judged on international performance and suggested British runners need to bring a stronger sense of purpose when competing abroad.

Johnson’s comments prompted a swift response from ex-world champion Linford Christie, who warned against overlooking the realities of Britain’s development system. Christie said it can be simple to offer judgments from the outside and stressed that pathways, competition structures and support in the UK differ from those in the United States.

The American has previously clashed with British sprinter Darren Campbell, after questioning Campbell’s explanation that a hamstring injury contributed to his failure to make the Olympic finals in both the 100m and 200m earlier this year. Johnson has maintained that British sprinting can appear more animated by internal disputes than by the pursuit of medals on the biggest stages.

Addressing an elite coaching conference in Birmingham, he also cast doubt on the idea that increased funding alone will lead to better outcomes. While acknowledging the growing financial backing for athletics in Britain, Johnson said success depends on culture, competition and mindset as much as resources. He contrasted the situation with some American athletes who train with limited support, arguing that difficult circumstances can sharpen focus and increase appreciation when opportunities arise.",ai,news
"January discounting has done little to lift Britain’s High Street after a weak festive period, according to a new industry survey. Retailers reported an early surge in shoppers chasing marked-down goods, but footfall and spending eased back as the month progressed, the British Retail Consortium said in figures compiled with consultancy partner KPMG. Like-for-like sales in January were up 0.6% on the same month a year earlier, a modest improvement for a period that is typically one of the strongest outside Christmas.

BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said households are still holding back on major purchases such as sofas and home electronics, with higher borrowing costs continuing to squeeze budgets. The group pointed to softer confidence amid uncertainty in the housing market and slower wage growth as factors weighing on discretionary spending.

Some categories performed better than others. Clothing and footwear fared more strongly than in December, while a number of department stores reported solid demand for beauty products and small gifts. By contrast, retailers selling furniture and larger household goods described trading as “subdued” despite extended sales and additional promotions.

Over the three months to January, like-for-like sales were flat, unchanged from the previous three-month period, the survey found. The BRC said retailers may face further pressure in the months ahead as consumers prioritise essentials and continue to seek value.",ai,news
"Telecoms equipment maker Nokia Networks reported higher fourth-quarter earnings as major operators including Orange and Telefónica stepped up investment in 5G and fibre upgrades. Operating profit for the three months to 31 December reached €1.12bn, up from €820m a year earlier, the company said on Thursday. The shares fell in early trading after Nokia posted an operating margin of 41.9%, below the 43.0% level expected by analysts and slightly down from 42.6% in the previous quarter. Revenue rose 7% to €7.6bn, supported by stronger demand for radio access gear and service contracts tied to network modernisation projects.

Management said industry fundamentals remained favourable, citing continued growth in mobile data usage and the expansion of private wireless networks for enterprise customers. Chief executive Pekka Lundmark noted that more than one-third of global subscribers are now on 5G-capable plans, calling it a “multi-year replacement cycle” for operators. However, he cautioned that the order pattern seen late last year could ease as carriers digest earlier spending and work through inventory. Nokia said it expects seasonally softer sales in the first quarter and reiterated its full-year outlook, projecting steady profitability and disciplined cost control. For the full year, net profit climbed to €2.9bn from €2.1bn, while sales increased to €30.4bn from €28.7bn.",ai,news
"Rapper Eminem has prevented Elvis Presley from securing a fourth chart-topper this year after “Like Toy Soldiers” debuted at number one on the singles chart. The track edged out Presley’s newly reissued “Are You Lonesome Tonight,” the latest release in a planned run of 18 remastered singles tied to the 70th anniversary of the singer’s birth. Entering the countdown at number three was “Almost Here,” a collaboration between former Westlife member Brian McFadden and Australian singer Delta Goodrem. “Like Toy Soldiers,” taken from Eminem’s album “Encore,” draws on a hook from Martika’s 1980s hit “Toy Soldiers” and continues the rapper’s recent run of success following “Just Lose It,” while addressing ongoing rivalries within hip-hop. Last week’s chart leader, Presley’s “It’s Now or Never,” dropped sharply, falling 13 places to number 14, though five Presley reissues remained inside the Top 40. Elsewhere, charity single “Grief Never Grows Old,” recorded by the One World Project to raise funds for tsunami relief, slipped to number eight.

"A record label linked to late R&B singer Aaliyah has been turned back in its effort to bring a lawsuit against the video-production contractor that arranged the aircraft used in the trip that ended in her fatal 2001 crash. An appellate court in New York ruled that the right to pursue a wrongful-death claim rests with the artist’s next of kin, not with her company, leaving the label without standing to sue. Aaliyah, 22, died along with eight others when a small plane went down shortly after takeoff in the Bahamas following the completion of a video shoot. Her relatives previously resolved their claims in a confidential agreement reached in 2003. Attorneys for the label said they were reviewing the ruling and had not decided whether to seek further review. Investigators examining the crash concluded the aircraft was carrying more weight than permitted and found evidence that the pilot had consumed drugs and alcohol. Aaliyah, who had been expanding a career that spanned music and acting, was later honored with posthumous accolades, and several of her releases achieved major chart success.",ai,news
"Two of the biggest US carriers, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, said surging jet fuel costs weighed heavily on their latest quarterly performance, underscoring how volatile energy markets continue to shape the industry’s outlook. Delta posted a net loss of $412m for the final quarter of 2025, compared with a $168m loss in the same period a year earlier, while United reported quarterly profit slipping 18% to $602m from $736m. Both airlines said fuel expenses rose sharply year on year and warned that elevated prices could keep margins under pressure into early 2026.

Delta, which has been working to rebuild profitability after a series of operational disruptions, said it expects results in the first quarter to remain weak as fuel bills and slower corporate travel demand collide with seasonal softness. United, the largest US carrier by international capacity, said it still anticipates remaining profitable but cautioned that its ability to offset higher costs will depend on ticket yields and capacity discipline across the market.

Investors reacted cautiously. Delta shares edged up 0.4% in morning trading after the company’s loss came in slightly narrower than some forecasts, while United stock fell 1.2% as analysts focused on softer unit revenue trends. Delta chief executive Ed Bastian said the quarter reflected “an operating environment defined by unusually high input costs and intense competition,” adding that the carrier would continue to prioritize efficiency initiatives.

For the full year, Delta reported a net loss of $980m, an improvement from the prior year’s $1.6bn deficit, citing lower non-fuel costs and stronger premium demand. The airline also said it would defer delivery of 38 narrow-body aircraft to preserve cash and better match capacity to demand. Analysts said fare pressure remains a risk as airlines add seats in key domestic routes, keeping prices competitive even as costs rise.",ai,news
"Music executive Marion “Suge” Knight was taken into custody over the weekend on suspicion of violating the conditions of his parole after authorities said they discovered marijuana during a traffic stop in Southern California. Knight was arrested Saturday in the Barstow area after officers pulled over a vehicle for an alleged moving violation, law enforcement officials said. He is expected to be held pending a hearing that will determine whether he will remain jailed or be returned to state prison while the alleged breach is reviewed.

Police reported that the stop occurred after the driver made an illegal turn. During a subsequent search, officers said they found suspected marijuana inside the car. Knight was also cited for an alleged insurance-related infraction, according to the report.

A woman riding in the vehicle, described by police as 18 years old, was also detained on suspicion of providing inaccurate identifying information and possessing a counterfeit identification card. Authorities said she was later released.

Knight, the founder of Death Row Records, has faced repeated legal problems over the years and has previously served jail time stemming from parole issues. In 2004, he completed a 10-month sentence linked to an incident in which prosecutors said he assaulted a man while still under supervision for an earlier conviction.

His name has long been associated with the tumultuous era of 1990s West Coast hip-hop. Knight was involved in a Las Vegas altercation in 1996 shortly before rapper Tupac Shakur was fatally shot in a drive-by attack; Knight was driving the vehicle Shakur rode in and was wounded. Death Row Records, which helped launch major careers including Shakur’s and Dr. Dre’s, has also drawn criticism for alleged ties to gang culture and for exacerbating rap’s regional rivalries.",ai,news
"Shares in Midlands-based miner BritCoal slid on Thursday after the company reported a sharply wider annual loss, highlighting continued disruption at several of its underground operations. The firm said it posted a deficit of £48.9m for 2024, compared with a £3.4m loss a year earlier, citing difficult seam conditions, unplanned equipment downtime and stoppages linked to pay talks. In morning trading, the stock fell 9% to 121p.

Chief executive Martin Keane, appointed in September, said the group was working to stabilise output and improve reliability across its deepest pits. BritCoal outlined a programme of operational changes, including revised shift incentives, a tighter preventative maintenance schedule and new extraction techniques designed to keep production moving when water ingress and roof instability occur.

Management described 2025 as a “reset period” and said it was targeting a return to positive earnings in 2026, provided productivity initiatives take hold and disruption eases. The company added that stronger coal market prices had not materially lifted results because much of its output was committed under earlier contracts at lower rates.

BritCoal said its average production cost rose to £1.33 per gigajoule, while realised prices averaged £1.19 per gigajoule, squeezing margins. The group operates a network of 13 surface and deep mines across Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Northumberland and the West Midlands.",ai,news
"South Korea’s Hyundai Motor said it will construct a second manufacturing facility in India as it seeks to capitalize on rising vehicle demand and expand its regional footprint. The automaker did not disclose the size of the investment, but said the new site will have an annual capacity of about 150,000 vehicles. Once operational, the additional plant would lift Hyundai’s total output capability in India—where it ranks as the country’s second-largest car producer—to roughly 400,000 units a year, the company said. Hyundai also outlined ambitious sales targets, projecting mid-teens growth in domestic deliveries in the near term and indicating that volumes could climb to around 400,000 vehicles by the end of the decade if market conditions remain favorable. The new factory is expected to be located near the company’s existing complex outside Chennai in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, a hub for auto and components manufacturing. Hyundai forecast that India’s overall passenger-vehicle market will continue to expand at a double-digit pace, approaching one million sales this year and moving toward 1.6 million by 2010. Industry analysts attribute the increase to expanding disposable incomes, limited public transportation options in many cities, and still-low private car ownership, which remains well below levels seen in developed economies. The company said it intends to use India not only to serve local buyers but also as an export platform for markets including Europe, Latin America and the Middle East, as part of its broader effort to climb into the top tier of global automakers.",ai,news
"A cannabis-derived prescription medicine developed by British biotech company GW Pharmaceuticals is moving closer to regulatory clearance in Canada, potentially opening a new treatment option for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). The product, known as Sativex, is designed to ease neurological symptoms associated with MS, including spasticity and pain. The development comes after a turbulent period for the firm, whose share price fell sharply in recent weeks when UK health authorities signaled they were not yet satisfied with the evidence supporting the drug’s clinical benefits. Canadian regulators have now indicated the application has progressed to the next stage of review, raising expectations that a decision could be reached within months.

MS affects an estimated 50,000 Canadians and tens of thousands of people in the UK. Patient groups say some sufferers already use smoked cannabis to manage symptoms, though doing so remains legally and medically problematic. If authorized, Sativex would offer a standardized dose delivered as an oral spray, potentially providing a regulated alternative to self-medication.

Industry analysts described the Canadian process as a significant milestone, noting that formal approval would mark one of the first instances worldwide of a pharmaceutical product based directly on cannabis extracts receiving national authorization. GW Pharmaceuticals said it is preparing for a possible launch early next year, assuming no major delays during final evaluation.

The company holds a UK government licence to cultivate cannabis for research and manufacturing. Sativex contains measured amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), compounds that researchers believe work together to reduce certain MS-related symptoms; the formulation is also being studied for other conditions, including inflammatory pain. Production relies on tightly controlled cultivation in the UK, with security measures typical of high-value pharmaceutical crops.

News of the Canadian review update lifted investor sentiment, with GW Pharmaceuticals’ shares edging higher in London trading as markets weighed the prospects for the company’s first major commercial approval.",ai,news
"Bath prop Matt Stevens has been drafted into England’s enlarged 30-man group for next weekend’s Six Nations trip to Dublin as head coach Steve Borthwick scrambles to cover a mounting injury list in the front row. With tighthead options stretched by Dan Cole’s calf problem and Will Stuart managing a shoulder complaint, Stevens has been placed on standby and could be in line for a first Test appearance if either player fails to prove fitness during the week.

Stevens, 29, had previously explored the possibility of representing Scotland through family links, but a review of his international status by World Rugby confirmed he is tied to England after featuring for an England age-grade side earlier in his career. The late call-up is a reward for strong Premiership form and for his performance in the recent England A fixture, where he impressed in the set-piece and played a role in two tries during a narrow win over a French selection.

England’s coaches are also weighing up alternative combinations in the scrum. Sale’s uncapped Asher Opoku-Fordjour remains an option, though he has spent much of this season on the loosehead side, and the staff are wary of changing the balance of the front row against an Irish pack renowned for pressure at the breakdown and in the tight exchanges.

There are further concerns in midfield after centre Manu Tuilagi was withdrawn late from club duty at the weekend with a hamstring issue. He is scheduled for a scan, while Ireland are monitoring the condition of utility back Jimmy O’Brien, who left Leinster’s match with an ankle knock. Despite those uncertainties, England are expected to keep faith with their established backline, with Harlequins’ Oscar Beard identified as the most likely replacement should a change be required.

The squad is due to assemble at England’s training base on Monday, with final selection decisions anticipated after midweek medical assessments.",ai,news
"Japanese telecoms and internet group SoftBank reported a deeper quarterly loss as it ramped up promotion of a newly introduced low-priced mobile plan aimed at budget-conscious customers. The company said the service, unveiled in December, has drawn close to 900,000 applications, but the rollout has required substantial marketing outlays. For the three months ending in December, SoftBank posted an operating loss of 7.5bn yen ($71.5m; £38.4m), compared with a smaller deficit a year earlier. Executives indicated the core business would have been profitable without the launch-related spending and said they expect results to turn positive during 2006, though they declined to provide a specific earnings forecast. SoftBank rose to prominence during Japan’s technology boom in the 1990s before being hit by the subsequent downturn, and has since rebuilt its profile through acquisitions. Its purchase of Japan Telecom helped strengthen its broadband unit, which ended December with more than 5.1 million subscribers, keeping it among the market leaders.",ai,news
"Model and entrepreneur Caprice and Holby City actor Jeremy Edwards have both exited the Celebrity Big Brother house following an unexpected double eviction on Friday night. Caprice was the latest contestant to leave in the programme’s planned fourth eviction, receiving just 5% of the public vote, and later told viewers she felt relieved to be out of the competition. Edwards was then removed in a further twist, departing in a surprise vote with 12% backing him to stay. With the final approaching, 19-year-old Blazin’ Squad singer Kenzie is now the bookmakers’ leading pick to claim the £50,000 prize for charity. Before the show, Caprice had been widely tipped to go early, with Ladbrokes listing her as a strong favourite for eviction and describing her as the standout candidate to be voted out so far this series. After Friday’s result, betting firms cut the odds on Kenzie, though they cautioned that a late shift in public support could still benefit former Happy Mondays performer Bez. Actress Brigitte Nielsen remains in the house alongside the other finalists. Earlier in the week, DJ Lisa I’Anson became the third celebrity to be voted out after a surprise eviction staged during a hide-and-seek task, saying she was pleased to leave and predicting Kenzie would win. The series champion will be confirmed on Sunday night.",ai,news
"Japan’s major brewers are increasingly looking beyond traditional lager as high excise duties and cautious consumer spending reshape the market for alcoholic drinks. Companies say demand is accelerating for low-tax, beer-tasting beverages made with alternative ingredients that allow producers to price products below standard beer while keeping familiar flavour profiles. Asahi Breweries has forecast a sharp expansion this year in the category often described as “new-genre” or “beer-style” drinks, and expects earnings to strengthen as it rolls out a new product formulated with soybean-derived components instead of malt. Industry analysts note that branding is central to the strategy, with names and packaging designed to resemble draft beer even when the contents fall outside legal beer definitions. Rival producers have already established footholds: Sapporo has built sales around a malt-free option, while Suntory has pushed blended drinks that combine low-malt beverages with distilled spirits such as shochu. The shift has been underway for years, as households sought cheaper substitutes during Japan’s prolonged economic slump, and brewers capitalised on the lower tax brackets applied to reduced-malt and non-malt formulations. Kirin is also preparing a new entry in the fast-growing segment, intensifying competition in a market where price and taxation are increasingly decisive.",ai,news
"The move to factor digital music downloads into the official UK singles chart has been postponed by four weeks, after industry concerns that smaller labels could be disadvantaged under the current online retail landscape. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) had been preparing to introduce download sales into the chart from 20 March, but the start date has now been shifted to 17 April while efforts are made to improve the visibility and availability of independent releases on major download services. BPI officials said they want to ensure that the chart reflects a broader range of music, noting that the catalogue carried by leading online outlets does not always match what is stocked in traditional retail. 

BPI chairman Peter Jamieson described the planned change as a major milestone for the charts, but said it should not proceed until there is greater confidence that independent repertoire is properly represented across digital platforms. He added that the delay would allow discussions with download retailers and chart administrators to address gaps in listings and reporting.

The Official UK Charts Company (OCC), which compiles the rankings as a joint venture between the BPI and the British Association of Record Dealers, agreed to the revised timetable at a board meeting on Wednesday. Under the new schedule, downloads will count towards the singles chart for the first time in the edition published on 17 April, covering sales from the week beginning 10 April. Similar chart integration has already taken place in the United States with Billboard’s main singles ranking.",ai,news
"Motley Crue guitarist Mick Mars is facing a $10 million lawsuit filed by a former partner who alleges he reneged on assurances that he would continue supporting her financially after their relationship ended. The plaintiff, Robin Mantooth, claims that throughout their time together Mars repeatedly promised to look after her if the couple separated, but she says he rejected the existence of any such arrangement when they broke up in December. In papers lodged in Los Angeles, Mantooth is seeking a division of assets, ongoing monthly payments and additional damages. She contends that the relationship began in 1990 and that she gave up her work as a documentary film-maker to live with the musician at his home in Malibu. Mantooth also alleges that since the split Mars, 53, has provided no financial assistance. The legal action comes as Motley Crue prepares for renewed activity following a five-year hiatus. Formed in the early 1980s, the band enjoyed a string of international successes, including charting singles in the UK. They are scheduled to begin a major tour later this year, with dates planned across the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia. Mars, whose birth name is Bob Allen Deal, recently underwent hip replacement surgery and has long lived with a degenerative rheumatic condition.",ai,news
"Rafael Nadal kept his momentum going at the Mexican Open in Acapulco, defeating Argentina’s Guillermo Canas to move into the semi-finals. The Spanish eighth seed, fresh from winning last week’s Brazil Open for his second ATP title, came through a tight opening set before pulling away to win 7-5 6-3. Nadal will next face Argentine wild card Mariano Puerta, who again upset the form book by edging Spain’s Felix Mantilla in a tense three-set contest, 6-4 3-6 7-6, after previously eliminating top seed Carlos Moya. In the other half of the draw, Argentina’s Agustin Calleri removed fifth-seeded Czech Jiri Novak 7-5 6-1, ending Novak’s bid to add to his past success at the event. Calleri, a former champion in Acapulco, set up a last-four meeting with Spain’s Albert Montanes. Montanes advanced to his first semi-final of the season by overturning a one-set deficit against sixth-seeded Italian Filippo Volandri, winning 4-6 6-3 6-4.

"Nasdaq Stock Market Inc., the operator of the technology-heavy Nasdaq exchange, has filed paperwork with U.S. regulators outlining plans for a public share offering that would place its stock on the very market it runs. In a registration statement submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said the transaction is expected to raise about $100m, though the proceeds would go to existing shareholders rather than to Nasdaq itself. The shares being offered were acquired through earlier private placements completed in 2000 and 2001, the filing indicated. Market participants said the move could further advance Nasdaq toward a more conventional stock-market listing, even as the company has previously played down speculation about a broader flotation. Nasdaq’s shares have already been trading in a limited fashion since 2002 on the OTC Bulletin Board, a venue associated with lightly traded securities. The exchange’s identity remains closely tied to fast-growing technology and biotech businesses, and it became a defining barometer during the late-1990s internet surge before plunging when the bubble collapsed.

"Matt Lucas and David Walliams have been ranked as the leading figures in British television comedy in a new annual survey compiled by the Radio Times. The Little Britain creators moved into first place ahead of Phoenix Nights writer and performer Peter Kay, who remains second, while The Office co-creator Ricky Gervais is placed third. The magazine said its panel assessed influence across the sector by weighing recent audience impact, industry recognition and commercial performance. Several performers entered the list for the first time, including Nighty Night actor Julia Davis, who appears in the top 10, and Black Books star Tamsin Greig, who features in the top 20. Lucas and Walliams’ climb follows a year of prominent awards attention for their sketch show, alongside strong viewing figures for the latest run on BBC Three, which delivered one of the channel’s biggest audiences since launch. Their ascent was also one of several notable shifts in the top 20: presenters Ant and Dec recorded a sharp rise into the top five, and Stephen Fry advanced further up the table after a busy year across entertainment and factual programming. BBC Three controller Stuart Murphy also gained ground, reflecting the growing profile of digital channels in commissioning comedy. By contrast, last year’s top-ranked name, chat show host Graham Norton, slipped down the order after a lighter on-screen schedule. The list also acknowledges production companies behind successful series, with outfits linked to multiple returning titles represented among the top 50.",ai,news
"Actor Michael Keaton has filed a lawsuit against Silver Gate Pictures, alleging he was injured during production of the action thriller Desert Line. In court papers lodged this week in Los Angeles County, Keaton says he suffered head and neck injuries after a pyrotechnic device malfunctioned during the filming of a battle scene on the 2003 movie, which the company helped finance and produce. The complaint seeks reimbursement for past and future medical treatment and alleges the incident caused ongoing physical discomfort and emotional distress.

A representative for Silver Gate Pictures declined to address the claims, citing the active legal case.

Desert Line, directed by veteran filmmaker Daniel Rourke, follows a U.S. special operations officer who defies an extraction order to escort civilians out of a conflict zone. The movie received mixed reviews at release and delivered only modest ticket sales, according to industry tracking services.

The lawsuit describes the incident as occurring during the use of small explosive charges intended to mimic impacts near an actor’s position. Keaton contends that a charge detonated closer than planned, striking him with debris and a pressure blast. The filing does not provide detailed medical records but states that he required evaluation and treatment from physicians and other healthcare providers.

Keaton is not asking for a specific dollar amount, instead requesting damages to be determined at trial. The complaint also names the production’s special-effects supervisor, alleging the defendants failed to properly inspect, place and coordinate the devices and did not ensure that qualified personnel handled the setup.",ai,news
"Greek sprinter Kostas Kenteris has rejected allegations that he engineered a traffic accident to sidestep a drug screening in the final days before the Olympic Games. Kenteris and fellow athlete Katerina Thanou are expected to be informed this week whether prosecutors will pursue criminal action linked to their failure to appear for an out-of-competition test. Investigators have been examining the circumstances of the incident, including claims that the pair may have staged the crash.

Speaking in a televised interview, Kenteris said the collision was real and described being overwhelmed when he learned officials believed he had missed the control. He said he set off in haste toward the Olympic Village in an effort to resolve the situation. Kenteris also maintained that he tried to undergo testing immediately after being taken to hospital, saying he asked medical staff at the Olympics-accredited facility to contact the International Olympic Committee so that samples could be collected there and then. According to Kenteris, no anti-doping representatives arrived during his stay.

The episode became a major story in Greece as Athens prepared to host the Games, and both Kenteris and Thanou later withdrew from competition. Kenteris has repeatedly asserted he did not attempt to evade testing and on Sunday accused Greek sporting officials and his former coach, Christos Tzekos, of failing to pass on information about the scheduled control.

The 31-year-old said he would welcome formal charges if they allow the case to be examined in court and his reputation to be restored. Kenteris, who won the Olympic 200 metres title in Sydney in 2000, also said he had been slated for a prominent ceremonial role at the opening of the Athens Games and had practiced for it before the controversy erupted.",ai,news
"Ticket buyers for this year’s Glastonbury Festival will receive personalised entry passes featuring a photograph and embedded electronic data, organisers have announced, in a move designed to curb ticket touting and counterfeit sales. The passes, which link the holder’s identity to a specific ticket, are expected to be issued ahead of the event in late June, with tickets due to be released in April.

Festival founder Michael Eavis said the new system is intended to ensure admissions are limited to those who purchased through authorised channels. He warned fans against buying from unofficial sellers, saying entry would be refused if the details on the pass did not match the person arriving at the gates.

Organisers said those who prefer not to carry the new pass may instead present recognised photo identification, such as a passport or driving licence, as a secondary option at check-in points. Staff will be equipped to verify details on site, with the aim of preventing ticket transfers and reducing forgeries.

More than 150,000 people are expected to attend the music and arts event on the Eavis family’s Somerset farm, and demand has continued to outstrip supply in recent years. The popularity of the festival has led to rapid sell-outs and a thriving resale market, prompting repeated efforts to tighten ticketing rules.

Emily Eavis, who helps run the festival, previously said organisers were considering stronger measures to protect genuine customers and discourage profiteering. Past attempts at personalisation, including printing purchasers’ names on tickets and requesting supporting documents at the gate, had mixed results, with some attendees arriving without the right paperwork and some resellers offering documents to match tickets.

No official line-up has been confirmed, although speculation about potential headline acts has begun circulating as the on-sale date approaches.",ai,news
"The government has moved to rebut media reports suggesting a shake-up at the top of Labour’s election operation, insisting there is no plan for Chancellor Gordon Brown to sideline campaign chief Alan Milburn. Work and pensions minister Alan Johnson said speculation about an internal power struggle was misplaced, arguing that senior figures were focused on presenting a united front as the party prepares for the next general election. His comments followed claims in the Sunday Business that Mr Brown had been asked to assume greater responsibility for media handling and overall messaging, with Mr Milburn shifting to a less prominent, coordinating position. Labour sources have long indicated the chancellor would be heavily involved in the campaign, but the latest reports come amid growing unease among some backbench MPs about the party’s performance against the Conservatives. Several MPs have privately complained that Labour has too often found itself reacting to Opposition initiatives rather than setting the agenda, a view echoed by commentators pointing to recent Conservative policy launches. The renewed talk of changes also follows a series of opinion polls indicating the gap between the parties has narrowed in recent weeks. Party strategists are said to be encouraged by internal tracking suggesting an uptick in support for Labour after last week’s Budget, increasing calls for Mr Brown to take a more visible role on the campaign trail. However, the Sunday Telegraph reported that Mr Milburn is resistant to any arrangement that would diminish his authority. Mr Johnson said both men would “work together” and dismissed suggestions of rivalry. Downing Street and Labour headquarters declined to address the reports directly.",ai,news
"Carlos Moya became the first player to retain the Chennai Open crown after outlasting Thailand’s Paradorn Srichaphan in a tense three-set final, winning 3-6 6-4 7-6 (7/5). Moments after lifting the trophy, the Spaniard said he would donate his £28,000 winner’s cheque to support victims of the Asian tsunami. Srichaphan, a former champion and four-time runner-up at the event, seized early control by taking the opening set, but Moya steadied his serve and broke late in the second to level the match. The deciding set swung repeatedly, with Moya trailing 5-2 before saving match points and dragging the contest into a tie-break he edged with aggressive baseline play. Tournament organisers said several players had already indicated they would contribute their earnings to relief operations, as the event proceeded in the wake of the 26 December catastrophe that has killed more than 150,000 people across the region. Srichaphan said he planned to make a separate donation for assistance in Thailand, where the death toll has exceeded 5,000.

"Organisers of this year’s Berlin International Film Festival say the event, which begins Thursday with the historical drama *Man to Man*, will highlight a renewed momentum in European filmmaking. Of the 21 titles vying for the festival’s top prizes, a majority come from European directors, with French productions forming one of the largest national contingents. Festival director Dieter Kosslick told reporters that the selection reflects growing confidence across the continent’s industry and a run of strong critical and box-office performances. While noting that major U.S. releases continue to draw audiences, he said the current line-up shows Europe has expanded both its range and ambition. Kosslick also dismissed suggestions that political tensions, including debate over the Iraq war, have cooled local interest in American cinema, arguing that programming decisions were driven by quality rather than sentiment. Around 350 films are due to be screened during the 10-day festival, and a further 300 titles will be presented at the European Film Market running in parallel for buyers and distributors. A number of high-profile actors are expected to appear, including Will Smith, Kevin Spacey and Keanu Reeves, though Kosslick said scheduling conflicts created by the earlier date of the Academy Awards have limited some attendance. He added that organisers are considering moving the festival to January next year to reduce future clashes. The Berlinale runs through 20 February.",ai,news
"Foreign Secretary David Miliband is to travel to Poland later this month to attend events marking the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, officials have confirmed. The Duke of Gloucester will accompany the British delegation for National Holocaust Memorial Day ceremonies on 27 January, alongside representatives from survivor organisations and faith groups. Historians estimate that more than a million people, the vast majority of them Jews, were murdered at the camp complex during the Second World War.

The announcement follows criticism from opposition politicians after it emerged that a junior minister had initially been expected to represent the UK at the main commemoration. Conservative foreign affairs spokesman William Hague welcomed the change of plan but accused the government of acting only after pressure mounted. “It is right that Britain is properly represented at a moment of such gravity,” he said, adding that the decision should have been made earlier.

In London, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are due to lead a national service of remembrance at Westminster Hall, with senior figures from across public life invited to attend. Buckingham Palace said the Queen will also host a reception for survivors and their families at St James’s Palace.

The commemorations come as renewed attention has focused on the responsibilities of public figures after a member of the Royal Family drew condemnation for wearing an offensive costume at a private party. Jewish leaders have said the anniversary is an opportunity to confront the consequences of Nazi ideology and to reinforce education about the Holocaust, in which about six million Jews were killed.",ai,news
"Top seed Novak Djokovic fought off two match points before edging past Spain’s David Ferrer in a tense Dubai Open showdown on Wednesday. The world number one needed two hours and 20 minutes to secure a 4-6 6-3 7-6 win, recovering from 4-6 down in the deciding-set tiebreak to clinch it 8-6. Djokovic struggled to find rhythm in the opening set, spraying errors from the baseline as Ferrer capitalised with sharp returns and consistent depth. The Serb steadied in the second, raising his first-serve percentage and forcing longer rallies to pull level. In a nervy final set, both players held serve under pressure before the match turned on a handful of points in the breaker, where Djokovic saved two match points with aggressive forehands and then closed out on his own opportunity. He advances to the quarter-finals to meet seventh seed Andrey Rublev, who beat Germany’s Jan-Lennard Struff 7-5 6-4. Djokovic said he was not alarmed by another long match, noting he had recently been pushed to three sets in successive outings.",ai,news
"Band Aid 20’s charity re-recording has remained at the top of the singles chart for a second consecutive week, keeping it in a strong position in the run-up to the Christmas number one. The track, which brings together a range of contemporary artists including Chris Martin and Jamelia, once again fended off competition from Kylie Minogue, whose I Believe in You held steady in second place. Ice Cube’s You Can Do It slipped a spot to third, while Destiny’s Child dropped to fourth with Lose My Breath. Girls Aloud completed the top five with their Children in Need release I’ll Stand By You, continuing to attract attention through its fundraising ties as well as its chart performance.

Among the week’s movers, Robbie Williams secured the only new entry in the top 10 with Misunderstood, a song recorded for his Greatest Hits collection. Elsewhere on the albums chart, there were no fresh releases across the top 40, reflecting an industry strategy of front-loading major launches earlier in the season to maximise holiday sales.

U2’s How to Dismantle an Atom Bomb extended its reign at number one for a third week, with Williams’ Greatest Hits holding at two. Il Divo climbed to third, while Maroon 5’s Songs About Jane continued its gradual rise to seven despite having been available for nearly a year.

"US rapper Travis Scott is facing a $30m (£24m) civil lawsuit from a former freelance stylist who alleges she was drugged and sexually assaulted by the artist and members of his entourage after a late-night television taping in 2022. The complaint, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Monday, claims the woman attended an after-show gathering following a music performance recorded for a major broadcast network, where she says a drink offered to her was tampered with and she later lost consciousness. She alleges she awoke in a private room and was assaulted, and that security staff prevented her from leaving immediately. Scott has not been charged in connection with the allegations.

A spokesperson for the musician, whose real name is Jacques Webster, denied the claims, describing them as “categorically false” and saying the plaintiff was attempting to “pressure a settlement through sensational allegations.” The network named in the suit said it could not discuss pending litigation but maintained it had “strong policies and procedures” in place for guests and contractors. The lawsuit also names three unidentified associates, a production company involved in the taping, and the corporate parent of the broadcaster, alleging negligence and failure to provide a safe workplace.

The plaintiff’s attorney said the woman delayed filing suit while seeking a resolution outside court and because she feared professional retaliation. The filing requests damages for medical expenses, emotional distress, and lost income, and seeks a jury trial. Scott, a Grammy-nominated artist with multiple chart-topping releases, has previously denied misconduct allegations in unrelated matters.",ai,news
"Canadian video game studio BioWare is planning to stage public auditions this weekend to recruit members of the public whose likenesses could appear in upcoming titles. The role-playing game developer, known for franchises including Mass Effect and Dragon Age, said it is looking for volunteers aged 18 to 99 to serve as facial reference for in-game characters. The company said selected participants will be paid a performer’s fee in exchange for permission to use their image in future projects. Organisers are asking interested people to attend sessions at a shopping centre in west Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, and to bring government-issued photo identification to confirm age and identity.

A spokesperson involved in the casting process said the studio builds worlds populated by large ensembles, requiring a range of faces beyond those typically seen in traditional modelling calls. The company is seeking “everyday people” as well as individuals with distinctive features, to help create more varied crowds and supporting roles across different settings, from towns and markets to military outposts and remote villages.

Those selected will undergo a 3D capture process that involves taking extensive photographic references from multiple angles so artists can generate a detailed digital head model. The studio said the resulting scans are designed to reproduce facial structure and skin detail with high fidelity, allowing developers to create characters that look believable at close range.

BioWare also said participants should understand that once the scanning is complete, the studio retains creative control over how the likeness is applied. A face may be used in different contexts across projects, potentially appearing as a protagonist in one game, a minor non-player character in another, or a villain elsewhere. The company said it would not be able to offer editorial approval over storylines, costumes, or character roles.",ai,news
"Defending champions Manchester United and Premier League pace-setters Chelsea have been handed demanding trips in the FA Cup fifth round draw, with United set to visit Everton and Chelsea heading to Newcastle. Two lower-league survivors remain in contention after Brentford and Hartlepool were paired again in a replay, the winners earning an away match at Southampton. Burnley, meanwhile, were given a home fixture against local rivals Blackburn in an all-Lancashire clash.

"A record number of schools across the UK are preparing to stage a nationwide mock general election in a government-supported programme designed to spark pupils’ interest in public life. Organisers said around 600 schools have already enrolled in the Y Vote Mock Elections 2005, coordinated by the Hansard Society, with more expected to join before voting begins. Participating pupils will take on roles commonly found in election campaigns, including standing as candidates, drafting speeches, planning messages and canvassing classmates for support.

Schools Minister Stephen Twigg said encouraging political understanding among young people was vital for the long-term strength of democratic participation. He said the project was intended to help pupils learn how elections work, why they matter, and how individual involvement can shape outcomes. By running campaigns and taking part in the count, he added, students would gain first-hand experience of the responsibilities and choices that come with voting.

The programme is being delivered in partnership with the Electoral Commission and the Department for Education and Skills. Michael Raftery, the Hansard Society’s project manager, said the aim was to recreate the atmosphere of a real contest while promoting citizenship education and informed debate in schools. He said mock ballots could help students understand competing priorities and the practical challenges parties face when trying to persuade voters.

Voting in schools is expected to take place in early May, close to the date widely anticipated for the next general election. Election packs sent to invited schools include ballot papers, guidance for running polling stations and materials to help pupils compare manifesto promises and key issues.",ai,news
"England prop Dan Cole has vowed to keep his focus on conditioning after a forearm fracture ended his hopes of featuring in this season’s Six Nations. The 33-year-old sustained the injury in Leicester Tigers’ 22-19 Premiership victory over Northampton Saints on Saturday, with scans later confirming a break to the ulna in his left arm. Cole is scheduled to have surgery early this week and is expected to be sidelined for six to eight weeks, putting his international availability in doubt.

Cole said he was determined to remain involved at the club while he recovers. “It’s obviously disappointing, but it doesn’t stop you doing the work you can do,” he said. “Once the operation is done, the plan is to get back in the gym quickly and keep the fitness side ticking over.”

He added that he had sought advice from team-mate James Cronin, who missed part of last season with a similar problem. “He told me the first few days are the toughest and then you can start moving forward again,” Cole said. “Hearing that helps, because you want to keep a routine and stay connected.”

Leicester head coach Michael Cheika described the timing as “cruel” after Cole had completed his first full match since December. “Dan has been building nicely and needed the minutes,” Cheika said. “He’s in excellent shape, and the frustrating part is that this comes just as he was finding rhythm. We’ll support him through the process, but it’s a significant blow.”",ai,news
"Top seed Alex de Minaur was sent tumbling out of the Brisbane International on Friday after a straight-sets loss to American hard-hitter Ben Shelton in the quarter-finals. De Minaur, touted as one of the favourites in the final tune-up events ahead of the Australian Open, was edged 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 as Shelton relied on a heavy serve and aggressive first-strike tennis to blunt the home player’s speed.

Shelton will meet Argentina’s Francisco Cerundolo in the semi-finals after the fifth seed defeated Austria’s Sebastian Ofner 6-3 3-6 6-2 in the day’s earlier match. In the other half of the draw, Belgium’s David Goffin rallied past third seed Karen Khachanov 4-6 7-6 (9-7) 6-4 and will face second seed Grigor Dimitrov, who advanced by beating fellow Bulgarian Adrian Andreev 6-2 4-6 6-1.

“I was serving well when it mattered and stayed calm in the tiebreak,” Shelton said. “Against a guy who gets so many balls back, you can’t let up.”

De Minaur downplayed the setback, saying his priority remains peaking in Melbourne. “This is part of the process,” he said. “The goal is to be ready for the Australian Open, and that’s where I want my best tennis.”",ai,news
"Baroness Betty Boothroyd has called for the House of Lords to appoint a dedicated presiding officer, arguing that members of the upper chamber should take greater responsibility for shaping its future. Speaking in a broadcast interview, the former Commons Speaker said the current constitutional arrangements left the Lords without clear leadership inside the chamber and risked undermining public confidence. She suggested that earlier changes to the Lords were introduced without sufficient agreement on the final destination, leaving peers and ministers to manage the consequences years later. “If reform is to mean anything, it needs a plan and it needs ownership,” she said.

The Labour government’s 1999 legislation removed the automatic right of most hereditary peers to sit and vote, leaving a small number in place on an interim basis while wider reform was considered. The move was presented as an initial step in a broader process, but successive administrations have struggled to settle on a lasting model for membership and powers.

Ministers indicated that further proposals could feature in the party’s next election platform, though they declined to set out details. Lord Falconer, the lord chancellor, said the balance of authority between the Commons and the Lords remained central to any overhaul, including how the two Houses resolve disagreements and scrutinise legislation. He said any commitments would be made in due course.

Under current arrangements, the lord chancellor performs the Lords’ key ceremonial and procedural functions while also holding senior roles in government and the legal system. Baroness Boothroyd said the concentration of responsibilities was no longer appropriate, and urged the appointment of a Speaker whose sole focus would be to chair proceedings, uphold standards and represent the Lords independently.",ai,news
"More than 1,000 residents and visitors gathered Sunday in the Nebraska town where television icon Johnny Carson spent much of his youth, offering a hometown farewell to the former “Tonight Show” host. Carson, who fronted the late-night program for three decades, died on Jan. 23 after a long struggle with emphysema, according to family representatives. He moved to Norfolk at age eight and lived there until entering the Navy, but maintained ties for years through frequent visits and charitable giving. The memorial drew former classmates, teachers and community leaders to the Johnny Carson Theater at the local high school. Organizers said Carson had declined a large public service in Los Angeles, where he lived later, preferring that any commemoration be rooted in the community that shaped him. Speakers recalled his early stage appearances as a teenage magician and highlighted donations that helped fund school and arts projects, including a major contribution toward a performing arts facility. National leaders also issued statements praising his impact on American entertainment.",ai,news
"A committee in the European Parliament has called for substantial changes to draft European Union legislation that would define how patents apply to inventions involving software, after lawmakers declined to endorse the latest version. Members of the Legal Affairs Committee said the European Commission should return with a revised proposal, arguing that the text failed to command broad political support and left key questions unresolved. The planned directive is aimed at clarifying whether and when innovations that rely on computer code to deliver a technical effect can qualify for patent protection across the EU, an area where national approaches and court decisions have varied.

The issue has divided industry and lawmakers for years. Critics, including some small technology firms and advocates of open-source development, warn that wider patentability could tilt the market toward large multinationals with extensive legal resources, making it harder for start-ups to innovate without fear of litigation. They also say ambiguous definitions could encourage a surge of broad claims over everyday programming techniques. Proponents, backed by parts of the manufacturing and software sectors, counter that clearer rules would protect genuine research and development, reduce uncertainty for investors and help European companies safeguard products from imitation.

The draft suffered political setbacks in the Council of the EU after Poland and other governments raised objections, prompting renewed debate in several national parliaments and intensifying lobbying from both sides. At the committee session, support for the text was limited, and lawmakers concluded that reopening the process would allow a more comprehensive discussion among member states before any final vote.

Observers frequently point to the United States, where software and certain online business methods can be patented, as a reference point in the debate. Opponents fear Europe could drift toward similarly expansive protections, while supporters insist the EU can craft a distinct, narrower standard.",ai,news
"London’s West End will turn the spotlight on its leading productions and performers on Monday as the Evening Standard Theatre Awards return for a ceremony at the National Theatre. Among the contenders for best musical is Mel Brooks’ The Producers, led by Nathan Lane and Lee Evans, facing competition from revivals including Sweeney Todd and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. In the race for best play, judges will choose from a varied shortlist that includes Edward Albee’s The Goat, or Who is Sylvia?, Martin McDonagh’s unsettling drama The Pillowman, and Alan Bennett’s schoolroom comedy The History Boys. The best actress category features Pam Ferris, Victoria Hamilton and Kelly Reilly, with Ferris recognised for her stage performance in Notes on Falling Leaves at the Royal Court, after a career better known to many television viewers. For best actor, Richard Griffiths, who plays teacher Hector in The History Boys, is nominated alongside Douglas Hodge for Dumb Show and Stanley Townsend for Shining City. Directors in contention include Luc Bondy for Cruel and Tender, Simon McBurney for his interpretation of Measure for Measure, and Rufus Norris for Festen, which also appears in the design category. Designers shortlisted range from Ian MacNeil, Jean Kalman and sound specialist Paul Arditti to Hildegard Bechtler for Iphigenia at Aulis and Paul Brown for False Servant. The Milton Shulman Award for outstanding newcomer will go to one of four rising actors: Dominic Cooper, Romola Garai, Eddie Redmayne or Ben Whishaw.

"Britain will not reopen talks on its annual EU budget rebate at next week’s European Council meeting, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has told MPs, insisting the arrangement remains warranted despite renewed calls for reform. Appearing before the Commons foreign affairs committee, Mr Straw said the mechanism—won by Margaret Thatcher in 1984 to offset what the UK argues is an uneven balance between what it pays in and what it receives back—should not be treated as a bargaining chip in discussions on the bloc’s future finances. His remarks follow comments by incoming European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso, who has floated the idea of redistributing the rebate among member states that are net contributors to the EU budget. Mr Straw said some governments in the enlarged 25-country Union still needed to accept the UK’s case, but added that London’s position was “straightforward” and would not be altered at the summit.

The Brussels gathering, beginning on 16 December, is expected to set the tone for protracted negotiations over the EU’s 2007–2013 spending plans, with diplomats warning that an agreement may not be reached until well into 2005 and possibly later. Several states—including the UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden—are pressing for overall spending to be limited to around 1% of the Union’s combined national income, while the Commission has proposed a higher ceiling of 1.26%. Mr Straw argued that adopting the Commission’s figure would amount to a sharp expansion in EU spending that few national governments could justify domestically.

He also said he hoped leaders could agree a timetable next year to begin membership talks with Turkey, while cautioning that accession itself would remain a distant prospect.",ai,news
"Software developers who distribute programs that covertly monitor activity on personal computers may soon face significant penalties under a new California measure aimed at curbing so-called spyware. The statute, set to take effect on 1 January after being signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, seeks to reduce unauthorized tracking and limit the theft of personal information by requiring clearer consent and stronger disclosure from companies that install software on users’ machines. Security specialists have warned that spyware is expected to remain a leading irritation and risk for home PC owners, in part because such programs can embed themselves deeply within operating systems and quietly transmit data back to third parties.

At its most damaging, spyware can capture sensitive details including account credentials and payment information, and it may alter browser settings or system controls to make removal difficult. Analysts say newer variants are routinely updated to evade detection, forcing consumers to rely on a mix of anti-spyware tools and frequent security patches. A common subset, often described as ad-supported software, can log browsing habits and trigger persistent pop-up advertising, disrupting normal use and potentially exposing users to further security threats through malicious links.

While lawmakers in Washington have been considering several proposals to address the problem nationwide, California’s action positions the state as an early mover on consumer computer privacy. The law prohibits the installation of software that commandeers a computer without permission and requires businesses to inform users when an application will collect data or change settings. It also allows individuals to pursue damages of up to $1,000 per incident, alongside possible enforcement by state authorities.

The legislation follows broader efforts in California to strengthen privacy protections. Recent industry surveys have suggested that spyware remains widespread on consumer PCs, with many machines carrying multiple hidden trackers. In the absence of clear legal standards, users have increasingly turned to free and commercial anti-spyware programs to detect and remove unwanted software.",ai,news
"General Motors said it expects profit to fall in 2025 compared with last year, pointing to persistent price pressure in the US market and continued restructuring costs in Europe. The automaker said rising expenses tied to employee medical benefits and warranty provisions in North America, along with weaker results at its financing arm, are likely to weigh on full-year performance. Even so, the company said it remains on track to achieve its targets for 2024 when it reports results later this month, citing solid demand for several high-margin models and cost controls implemented in the second half of the year.

GM, which sells vehicles under brands including Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac in the United States and Opel and Vauxhall in Europe, said it plans to maintain its shareholder return commitments for 2025, with dividends and buybacks broadly in line with the current year. However, it forecast earnings per share next year in a range below 2024 levels, reflecting what executives described as a “highly competitive” environment and the impact of ongoing investments in electrification and software.

Chief executive Mary Barra said management is focused on improving profitability across regions and strengthening free cash flow generation, adding that the company’s long-term financial goals remain unchanged. GM said its European operations should show narrower losses in 2025 as a multi-year efficiency programme continues, including capacity adjustments and headcount reductions concentrated in Germany and the UK.

In other regions, the company reported progress during 2024, including improved margins in Asia-Pacific and a return to profitability in parts of Latin America and the Middle East, helped by new model launches and a more favourable mix of sales. GM’s finance subsidiary, which has been a significant contributor in recent years, is expected to post lower net income in 2025 due to tighter credit conditions and a shift in loan demand. The company reiterated that it is aiming to lift annual earnings materially over the next several years through cost cuts, product upgrades and growth in its services business.",ai,news
"Theo van Gogh’s short film *Submission* has been removed from the programme of the International Film Festival Rotterdam after organisers cited heightened security concerns. The title had been scheduled to screen as part of a freedom-of-speech strand honouring the Dutch director, who was killed in 2004, and was one of three of his works selected for the tribute. The film, made in collaboration with Somali-born Dutch politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, sparked fierce debate for its depiction of women’s lives under Islam and was widely linked to the threats van Gogh received after it aired on Dutch television. He was shot and stabbed in Amsterdam in November of that year.

Festival officials said the decision to withdraw the film was taken after consultations with authorities and partners, and stressed that the move was based on risk assessment rather than editorial judgement. Two other van Gogh titles remain on the schedule, including the first theatrical screening of his final feature, *06/05*, which examines the killing of politician Pim Fortuyn.

The 10-day festival opens on Wednesday with French documentary-maker Raymond Depardon’s courtroom film *The 10th District Court: Moments of Trials*. Fourteen films are competing for the festival’s Top Tiger prizes, aimed at highlighting emerging directors. New programme sections introduced this year include strands focusing on future-oriented cinema and global filmmaking, with added spotlights on Russian and South-East Asian work. An Iraqi-German production, *Underexposure*, exploring daily life in Iraq after Saddam Hussein, is also among the featured titles.",ai,news
"News Corp, the media group controlled by Rupert Murdoch, is weighing whether to expand into the video games business as it searches for new areas of growth beyond traditional publishing and broadcasting. The Wall Street Journal reported that chief operating officer Peter Chernin told investors the company has been reviewing “a wide range” of game developers and publishers and has held preliminary talks with advisers about possible acquisitions. One company said to have been discussed internally is Los Angeles-area publisher Activision, though no approach has been confirmed and any deal would depend on valuation and strategic fit.

Interest in the sector has been fueled by the continuing rise of console gaming, led by platforms such as Sony’s PlayStation, Microsoft’s Xbox and Nintendo’s GameCube, which have helped push game sales into mainstream entertainment. Modern titles increasingly resemble film productions, with large teams, sophisticated graphics and marketing campaigns that can rival Hollywood releases. As development costs have climbed, publishers have also benefited from higher retail prices and longer-lived franchises, making the business attractive to media companies seeking predictable revenue streams.

Chernin cautioned, however, that finding the right purchase may prove challenging. He said News Corp is trying to navigate between the biggest players—such as Electronic Arts, whose market value is far higher—and smaller studios that may depend heavily on a limited number of brands. Activision’s market capitalization has been estimated at just under $3bn, compared with more than $17bn for Electronic Arts, according to recent market data.

The industry has also been undergoing a wave of consolidation, with major publishers seeking scale to spread development risks and secure access to popular titles. Ubisoft, one of Europe’s largest game makers, has recently taken steps to preserve its independence after Electronic Arts disclosed plans to build a significant stake, prompting analysts to predict further mergers across the sector.",ai,news
"India has reached a long-term energy agreement with Iran valued at about $40bn, committing to purchase several million tonnes a year of liquefied natural gas while also opening the door for Indian companies to invest in upstream projects in the Islamic Republic. Officials said the pact is intended to bolster fuel security as India’s economy expands and domestic output fails to keep pace with demand. The arrangement, announced after meetings in New Delhi that brought together major Middle Eastern producers and leading Asian importers including China, Japan and South Korea, mirrors recent supply-and-investment packages Tehran has been offering to anchor long-term buyers.

Under the outline terms disclosed by the two sides, Iran would begin delivering roughly 7.5 million tonnes of LNG annually over a 25-year period starting in 2009, with pricing and shipping details to be finalised in subsequent contracts. In parallel, a consortium led by state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corporation is expected to pursue participation alongside the National Iranian Oil Company in developing the Yadavaran and Jufeyr oilfields, according to a joint statement.

The announcement came as ONGC indicated it was also exploring acquisitions of overseas assets, including properties formerly linked to Russia’s embattled Yukos. India’s crude production has largely plateaued in recent years, leaving refiners increasingly reliant on imports. Government figures show the country now meets about 70% of its oil needs from abroad, with consumption rising sharply over decades to around 2.4 million barrels per day.",ai,news
"A US public television distributor said it will alter a scene in the BBC Films drama *Dirty War* for its forthcoming broadcast, citing heightened sensitivity among American broadcasters to indecency complaints and potential regulatory repercussions. The film, which portrays a fictional terrorist incident involving radiological material in central London, includes a brief sequence showing a nude female survivor being decontaminated after exposure to chemicals. PBS programming executive Jacoba Atlas said the network considers the moment peripheral to the plot and does not want the broadcast to be derailed by disputes over content. Rather than removing the sequence entirely, PBS plans to substitute alternate footage and adjust camera framing so the decontamination is depicted without an explicit frontal view.

The decision comes as US stations face increased scrutiny over sexual content on free-to-air television. Last year, the Federal Communications Commission imposed a $550,000 fine on CBS after a fleeting onstage exposure involving singer Janet Jackson during the Super Bowl halftime show, a penalty that has prompted many broadcasters to reevaluate standards for nudity, language and graphic imagery. Atlas said airing the unedited film could expose PBS and its member stations to financial and legal risk, and might lead some local outlets to decline the programme altogether. By making limited edits, she said, PBS aims to keep the film available to a wide audience while avoiding content that could trigger formal complaints. The film has previously aired uncut in the UK, and is scheduled to be shown without edits on US cable channel HBO later this month.",ai,news
"The indie comedy-drama *Riverbend* emerged as the top winner at this year’s Independent Spirit Awards, collecting five trophies from five nominations and cementing its status as a late-season awards contender. The film received the night’s top prize for best feature, while filmmaker Lena Hart was honored for best director and shared the best screenplay award with co-writer Daniel Cho. Performances in *Riverbend* were also recognized, with Marcus Peña winning best lead performance and supporting prizes going to Alana Reed and Dominic Shaw. The strong showing comes as the film heads into the Academy Awards with four nominations, adding momentum ahead of Sunday’s ceremony. Now in its 21st year, the Spirit Awards celebrate projects produced outside the major studio system and traditionally take place in the final stretch of the awards calendar. Elsewhere, best actress went to Isabel Rojas for her portrayal of a young paramedic navigating political unrest in the Chilean drama *Night Sirens*, a role that has also earned her an Oscar nomination. The award for best first screenplay was claimed by Priya Nair for *Night Sirens*. Actor-writer-director Eli Barker won best first feature for *Summer Static*. France’s *The Silent Province* took best international film, while the environmental investigation *Tide Line* won best documentary.

"The 1946 holiday classic It’s a Wonderful Life is being developed as a stage musical by producer Jon Thoday, known for backing the boundary-pushing hit Jerry Springer – The Opera. Thoday is partnering with composer and writer Steve Brown, whose previous theatre work includes the award-winning Spend Spend Spend. A representative for the production said the project remains in its early phases, with no casting decisions, venue or premiere date confirmed. Development activity has been underway in London, where workshops have been held to test material, and a small group of performers recently presented songs from the show to invited backers at a private industry event. Thoday said he has wanted to adapt the story for the stage for nearly two decades. The film, directed by Frank Capra and led by James Stewart, was adapted from Philip van Doren Stern’s short story The Greatest Gift.

"A senior executive at insurance brokerage Marsh & McLennan has admitted to wrongdoing amid a widening investigation into alleged bid manipulation in the commercial insurance market, according to New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. The executive, identified by the attorney general’s office as senior vice president Robert Stearns, entered a guilty plea to charges related to a scheme to deceive clients, a case that prosecutors say could result in a prison term ranging from 16 months to four years under state sentencing guidelines. Authorities said Stearns has also agreed to assist investigators and provide testimony in related proceedings as the inquiry continues across the industry.

Marsh, in a brief statement, said it was disappointed by the developments and reiterated that it would continue to work with investigators. The firm added that it intends to address outstanding legal matters and maintain strong compliance practices while continuing to serve clients.

Prosecutors allege that between 2002 and 2004 Stearns directed insurers to submit deliberately uncompetitive quotes in response to client requests for coverage, allowing Marsh to present an appearance of a competitive process while steering business toward a preferred insurer. The attorney general’s office said the alleged conduct enabled the brokerage to influence which carrier ultimately won an account, shielding existing insurers from losing renewals and potentially increasing the brokerage’s compensation.

In one example described by investigators, an internal email allegedly showed Stearns requesting a so-called “B” quote from American International Group that would be priced higher and offer narrower terms, a move prosecutors said was designed to make the incumbent provider, Chubb, appear more attractive.

Marsh continues to face scrutiny from federal regulators as well. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has requested information concerning certain shareholder-related transactions, including dealings involving investors holding at least 5% of the company’s stock, according to people familiar with the matter.",ai,news
"India’s government has cleared the way for privately owned airlines to begin operating long-distance international services, a policy shift intended to expand capacity and put downward pressure on fares as outbound travel grows. Officials said the new permissions would be rolled out in stages, with some high-demand corridors—particularly flights to Gulf destinations such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates—remaining reserved for state-run carriers for an initial transition period of up to three years. Industry executives said the first beneficiaries are expected to include Jet Airways and Air Sahara, both of which have built sizable domestic networks that could feed passengers into overseas routes.

The decision comes amid surging demand tied to strong economic growth and rising household incomes. Aviation analysts in Delhi estimate passenger numbers have been climbing at close to one-fifth year-on-year, a pace that has strained airports and air-traffic systems. “The biggest bottleneck is on the ground,” said one observer familiar with the sector, noting that several major gateways still lack modern terminals, adequate baggage handling and sufficient runway capacity for heavier international traffic.

The government has reiterated plans to upgrade and, in some cases, bring in private operators to manage airports, though progress has been uneven. Separately, New Delhi has moved to make the sector more attractive to global partners by increasing the cap on foreign investment in domestic airlines to 49% from 40%. Media reports also say India and the United States may reopen talks early next year on expanding bilateral flight rights.",ai,news
"Tensions between the two prominent heirs of India’s Reliance Group again surfaced this week, this time affecting deliberations at one of the conglomerate’s key subsidiaries. Anil Ambani, vice-chairman of India Petrochemicals Limited (IPCL), did not attend a scheduled meeting of senior executives on Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter. His absence follows his recent attempt to step down from the post, a move that has not been formally accepted by his elder brother Mukesh Ambani, who leads the broader group and also holds ultimate authority at IPCL.

The IPCL board convened in Mumbai to review the company’s performance for the October–December period. Executives said the agenda also included discussion of Anil Ambani’s proposed resignation, with several directors urging him to reconsider. However, the board did not agree to a separate request linked to the dispute: Anil has sought the removal of a fellow director, Anand Jain, whom he has publicly blamed for deepening divisions within the family and influencing decision-making around the brothers.

Anand Jain, regarded in corporate circles as a close associate of Mukesh Ambani, has not commented publicly on the allegations. Company officials declined to discuss internal personnel matters but confirmed that the board had met to approve quarterly disclosures.

In a parallel development, directors at Reliance Energy, another group company headed by Anil Ambani, issued a statement on Wednesday reiterating their support for his leadership. Reliance Group gained control of IPCL in 2002 after purchasing the government’s 26% holding during India’s privatisation programme.

With Mukesh serving as chairman and Anil as deputy, the session is expected to bring the brothers into direct contact amid a dispute that has drawn unusually public scrutiny.",ai,news
"Chancellor Rachel Reeves will present the government’s next Budget to the House of Commons on 12 March, the Treasury has confirmed. The statement said the Budget will be delivered at 12:30 GMT, following Prime Minister’s Questions, in keeping with the usual parliamentary timetable. The Budget is expected to provide an updated assessment of the public finances and the wider economic outlook, alongside decisions on taxation, borrowing and spending plans. With a general election widely anticipated later in the spring, the announcement is likely to sharpen political dividing lines over fiscal policy, public services and living costs. Officials noted that the chancellor will also publish the latest forecasts from the independent budget watchdog, setting out projections for growth, inflation and debt. 

If Parliament is dissolved soon after the Budget, ministers may have limited time to legislate for any tax changes through a Finance Bill. In such circumstances, a pared-back bill would typically be fast-tracked with cross-party agreement to ensure the continued legal collection of duties and other revenues. More complex measures are often deferred, with a fuller Finance Bill returning after polling day, depending on the outcome of the election. 

Business groups and tax advisers called for a focus on stability rather than short-term electoral incentives. “Pre-election Budgets can encourage giveaways that are difficult to sustain,” said one senior partner at a major accountancy firm, urging ministers to prioritise predictability for employers and households.",ai,news
"Former Labour MP George Galloway has urged those holding humanitarian worker Margaret Hassan to free her, saying he is ready to assist efforts to secure her release. Mrs Hassan, 59, a senior figure with the aid agency Care International in Iraq, was seized in Baghdad on 19 October and has not been seen in public since. Mr Galloway, who was removed from the Labour Party over his outspoken criticism of the Iraq conflict, made the comments in London during a weekend gathering of delegates from his newly launched Respect coalition.

He rejected reports that he intended to address the kidnappers directly through the Arabic-language broadcaster Al Jazeera, insisting that any involvement on his part would be aimed at helping intermediaries rather than seeking personal exposure. “I have stayed away from previous cases,” he told supporters, adding that Mrs Hassan had long been known for opposing both the war and the years of international sanctions that preceded it. He said he would consider travelling to the region or assisting through contacts if it could help prevent harm.

A spokesperson later said Mr Galloway shared acquaintances with Mrs Hassan and had been approached by people concerned about her safety. Since the abduction, Al Jazeera has aired several recordings of Mrs Hassan, the most recent showing her calling for British forces to leave Iraq and urging her organisation to shut its Baghdad office. Care International has since suspended its remaining work in the country.",ai,news
"IBM said it will invest $120m over the next four years to expand its work with Linux and other open-source tools, aiming to make it simpler for corporate clients to deploy the software across everything from smartphones and tablets to high-end data-center systems. The company said the funding will support engineering, research partnerships and customer outreach designed to improve performance, security and management of Linux-based systems in mixed IT environments. Executives cited rising demand from enterprises looking to standardize their technology stacks while reducing licensing costs and avoiding dependence on a single vendor.

A significant portion of the initiative will focus on collaboration software and device support, IBM said, with new Linux-compatible components planned for its digital workplace offerings. Those products are intended to let employees access business applications, messaging and shared documents regardless of whether they connect through a desktop computer, a thin client or a mobile device. IBM said it plans to enhance tools that help administrators roll out updates and enforce policies across fleets of Linux desktops and handhelds, an area where customers have asked for tighter integration with existing corporate systems.

The company pointed to recent growth in Linux deployments among large organizations, particularly those modernizing internal workflows and moving more applications onto cloud infrastructure. IBM has long backed open-source development, contributing code and staff time to major projects and releasing versions of its software for Linux platforms. Open-source proponents argue that publicly available source code encourages peer review, faster fixes and broader experimentation, benefits IBM said it expects to translate into more reliable products for clients.",ai,news
"Shareholders dissatisfied with Deutsche Boerse’s pursuit of the London Stock Exchange will be unable to force a vote on senior leadership changes before the company’s next annual gathering in late May, according to Reuters. The Sunday Times reported that activist hedge funds TCI and Atticus were preparing to press for the departure of chairman Rolf Breuer and chief executive Werner Seifert, arguing that the bid strategy risks eroding shareholder returns. Deutsche Boerse told Reuters that any formal request to remove members of its supervisory board must be handled at the annual general meeting scheduled for May 25, limiting investors’ ability to accelerate a decision through an earlier vote.

TCI and Atticus have publicly urged the exchange operator to prioritize returning capital to shareholders instead of pursuing a costly takeover campaign. “We are long-term investors and are experienced in removing management. We are not scared to take this to its conclusion this time,” Atticus partner David Slager was quoted as saying by the Sunday Times. The newspaper also said TCI had begun assembling potential candidates to replace the current leadership.

The funds hold a stake of more than 5% in Deutsche Boerse, a level that in many cases can be used to call an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting. Still, under German corporate rules, the company does not require a shareholder vote to make a takeover offer, leaving opponents focused on governance pressure rather than blocking the bid directly.

Deutsche Boerse is competing with pan-European exchange group Euronext for control of the London Stock Exchange, fueling speculation that the contest could escalate into a higher-priced bidding battle. Any rapid developments may be constrained by regulators, with the UK Office of Fair Trading expected to conclude its review of competition issues tied to the rival proposals in March.",ai,news
"France’s financial markets authority has lodged formal complaints against conglomerate Vivendi and two senior executives over a recent convertible bond offering, alleging that investor disclosures may have been insufficient and that managers could have traded while in possession of non-public information. The Autorité des marchés financiers said it has opened proceedings involving the company, its chief executive Jean-René Fourtou and chief operating officer Jean-Bernard Lévy. A complaint was also filed concerning Deutsche Bank, which advised on the transaction and handled placement of the bonds with investors, leaving it potentially exposed to sanctions if the regulator’s claims are substantiated.

According to people familiar with the matter cited by wire services, the regulator is examining whether the prospectus failed to clearly present certain risks and strategic contingencies, and whether the executives had access to sensitive details at the time they purchased portions of the offering themselves. Investigators are reported to be focusing on whether the two men knew of expressions of interest in Vivendi’s U.S. assets from investor Marvin Davis during marketing of the bonds.

Vivendi has denied wrongdoing, saying it considers the complaints unfounded and that relevant information was already in the public domain. The company argues that any approach regarding its American holdings had been discussed openly and, in any case, was not actionable after being turned down by the board.

The AMF is also reviewing claims that management was weighing the possibility of exercising rights to acquire British Telecom’s stake in Cegetel around the same period. Vivendi said such a move was merely one option among several and that markets were aware it could be considered.

The case comes as the French regulator continues to take a hard line on disclosure standards. Vivendi has previously faced penalties from the AMF following an investigation into statements made to investors during a period of aggressive acquisitions.",ai,news
"Postcards created by artists such as Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin were among the first to be snapped up within hours of the opening of the Royal Academy of Arts’ annual Secrets fundraising sale. Buyers do not learn who made a particular work until it has been purchased, when the artist’s name can be found on the reverse. Royal College of Art spokesperson Sue Bradburn said a number of high-profile contributors remained available, including photographer Mario Testino. Each postcard is sold for a fixed price of £35. The event began at 8am on Friday and is due to finish at 6pm on Saturday. Bradburn said the day started with a long line outside the venue, though the crowd had eased later in the morning. She noted that many early purchasers appeared to have arrived with specific targets in mind, spending time carefully comparing the small-format works before choosing. The postcards have been on display for public viewing since 19 November. Contributors this year also include filmmaker Ken Loach, fashion designer Hussein Chalayan and musician Graham Coxon, alongside students and recent graduates from the Royal College of Art and other art schools. Proceeds will support the RCA Fine Art Student Award Fund, which provides bursaries and grants. The sale is in its 11th year.",ai,news
"The global installed base of personal computers is on course to climb sharply over the next several years, reaching about 1.3 billion systems by 2010, according to a new forecast from market researchers at Forrester Research. The firm said the expansion will be fueled primarily by rising demand in developing economies, with countries such as China, India and Russia accounting for more than a third of all additional machines shipped during the period. China alone is projected to add roughly 178 million PCs by 2010, the report estimated, as falling prices and broader internet access bring first-time buyers into the market. Forrester said domestic manufacturers are likely to gain the upper hand in these regions by offering lower-cost models and configurations tailored to local languages, software needs and purchasing power. The outlook arrives days after IBM, long associated with the early PC industry, agreed to sell its personal computer business to Lenovo, China’s largest computer maker, in a transaction valued at $1.75bn (£900m). The combined company is expected to rank as the world’s third-largest PC supplier. “Competitive advantage in emerging markets will increasingly come from local companies that can align design, pricing and applications with regional conditions,” said Simon Yates, a senior Forrester analyst. The study puts the current worldwide PC population at about 575 million units, while predicting more mature markets in the United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific will collectively add around 150 million PCs by 2010. India is forecast to bring in about 80 million new users, with Indonesia adding about 40 million.",ai,news
"Hayao Miyazaki’s newest animated feature, “Howl’s Moving Castle,” will roll out in about 50 markets worldwide, according to its distributor. The film opened strongly in Japan, where it set a new early box-office benchmark by earning roughly 1.5 billion yen in its first weekend. Miyazaki, who won this year’s Academy Award for “Spirited Away,” has drawn renewed international attention to Japanese animation, and the studio expects that momentum to carry into overseas theaters. Adapted from a fantasy novel by British writer Diana Wynne Jones, the story follows a young woman cursed by a witch and transformed into an elderly figure, prompting her to seek refuge in a wandering castle owned by the mysterious wizard Howl as she searches for a way to reverse the spell. A Toho representative said the picture has attracted notable interest from audiences and media abroad. The international release is scheduled to begin with South Korea in late December, followed by France in mid-January.",ai,news
"Madagascar has finalized the transition from the Malagasy franc to the ariary, completing a multi-year overhaul of its monetary system. Beginning Monday, retailers, employers and government agencies must list prices, salaries and official fees exclusively in the new unit, which was quoted at about 1,890 to the US dollar in early trading. The franc has ceased to be legal tender, though the central bank said it can still be exchanged at commercial banks for several years to ease the changeover for households and businesses. Officials said the shift, launched in phases in 2003, is meant to strengthen monetary credibility after a period of sharp depreciation and to curb losses linked to fake notes that had circulated widely. A senior central bank representative described the move as a statement of national autonomy, noting that the name “ariary” revives a traditional term used for money on the island before colonial administration.",ai,news
"The European Parliament has voted down draft legislation that would have expanded the scope for patenting computer-implemented inventions, sending the proposal back to EU institutions for further review. Lawmakers supported a motion to reject the text outright, meaning the measure cannot proceed in its current form and would need to be reintroduced after new consultations if it is to return to the legislative agenda. Supporters of the plan, including several large technology firms and industry groups, argued that clearer patent rules are necessary to encourage investment in research and development and to give European companies confidence that novel software-driven products can be protected from imitation. A spokesperson for a Brussels-based trade association said innovators would be more likely to develop new tools and services if the legal framework offered predictable safeguards for intellectual property. Backers also contended that the EU approach sought to draw boundaries that would prevent the broadest kinds of claims seen elsewhere, where patents may cover certain methods of doing business as well as code-based solutions. Critics, however, warned that the proposal risked granting overly strong rights for ideas implemented in software, potentially enabling litigation-heavy strategies and making it harder for smaller developers to compete. Opponents also said the measure could create legal uncertainty for collaborative development models, including open-source projects, by increasing the likelihood of infringement disputes. The bill had faced repeated setbacks in recent months, including delays linked to objections from some national delegations and calls from parliamentary committees to revise key provisions. Under EU procedures, any future version would still require approval from both the Parliament and a qualified majority of member states before it could become law.",ai,news
"Plans by a major Hollywood studio to depict Dominica’s indigenous Carib community as cannibals in an upcoming instalment of a blockbuster pirate franchise have drawn sharp criticism from the group’s leadership. Carib Chief Marcus Laurent said meetings with representatives of the production team indicated that the screenplay contains “repeated references to cannibalism” that, he was told, are central to the plot and unlikely to be altered. Dominica’s government has confirmed that the film-makers are scouting locations on the island and have expressed interest in shooting several sequences there, citing the island’s rainforest landscape and coastline.

The Caribs, also known as the Kalinago, have long rejected accounts that portray their ancestors as cannibals, arguing the label was used by European colonisers to justify conquest and dispossession. “We resisted invasion, and that resistance was rewritten as barbarity,” Mr Laurent said. “We cannot allow old stereotypes to be recycled for entertainment.”

Filming is expected to begin later this spring, and local casting calls have already attracted large numbers of applicants seeking work as extras, according to officials involved in the preparations. Around 3,000 Kalinago people live in Dominica, which has a population of roughly 70,000, and community representatives say they worry the portrayal could affect how indigenous people are viewed by tourists and the wider public.

Mr Laurent said he has contacted indigenous organisations in the Caribbean and beyond to support an appeal for revisions. He acknowledged, however, that opinion within the community is divided, with some residents favouring the economic boost the production could bring. The studio did not respond to requests for comment.",ai,news
"Fox has begun developing a U.S. drama serial inspired by the BBC soap EastEnders, according to industry reports. Trade publication The Hollywood Reporter said the network has commissioned early scripts and enlisted EastEnders head writer Tony Jordan alongside entertainment entrepreneur Simon Fuller to help shape the adaptation. The proposed series would shift the setting to Chicago, focusing on the intertwined lives of working-class residents in a tight-knit neighborhood. The move comes after the original British program was dropped by BBC America last year following weak audience figures. Previous attempts to translate U.K. hits for American viewers have produced mixed results; NBC’s remake of the BBC comedy Coupling, for instance, was pulled from its prime-time schedule after struggling in the ratings. Meanwhile, EastEnders has faced increased competition in the U.K., with recent viewing figures trailing ITV’s Emmerdale. Executives have shown renewed interest in prime-time soaps in the U.S. after the breakout performance of ABC’s Desperate Housewives, which blended drama with a satirical edge.",ai,news
"Chinese authorities have taken three senior managers from dairy producer Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group into custody amid allegations of financial misconduct, according to state media and company disclosures. Yili said its board chairman, chief financial officer and the executive responsible for securities affairs are cooperating with investigators, and the firm has convened a special board session to address governance issues and business continuity. A company representative declined to detail the reasons for the detentions, but Xinhua cited people familiar with the inquiry as saying it centers on suspected misappropriation of corporate funds.  

The detentions come after weeks of market chatter about Yili’s accounting practices and past financing decisions. Several domestic outlets have reported that investigators are reviewing transactions linked to a management-led deal carried out in 2003, including claims that hundreds of millions of yuan were diverted for purposes unrelated to core operations. Yili has not confirmed the amount under review.  

Trading in Yili’s shares was halted after the stock posted a sharp decline earlier in the week, heightening investor unease. The company is one of the largest players in China’s dairy industry, competing with Mengniu Dairy and Bright Dairy in a market that has expanded rapidly as consumer demand for packaged milk has increased. Analysts said the case could prompt closer scrutiny of corporate controls across the sector, particularly among firms that relied on aggressive financing during periods of fast growth.",ai,news
"Bath have brought back former scrum-half Andy Williams on a short-term agreement after securing his release from the Neath-Swansea Ospreys. The Wales international, whose deal with the Welsh region was set to run out in June, will remain with the Premiership club until the close of the current campaign. Bath moved quickly to add experience at scrum-half with Martyn Wood sidelined by injury and not expected to return until February, leaving Nick Walshe short of proven cover. Williams said he was keen to seize the chance to rejoin a club he knows well. Capped by Wales against Romania in 2003, he is expected to be considered for selection for Monday’s league fixture away to Sale Sharks. Williams has recently found opportunities limited at the Ospreys, slipping behind New Zealander Jason Spice and with younger options Richie Rees and Rhodri Wells pushing for more game time. Bath director of rugby Jack Rowell said Williams’ recent Heineken Cup and Celtic League involvement made him an ideal fit for the run-in.",ai,news
"A new industry initiative is aiming to help smaller record labels place more of their catalogues on major digital platforms, as music consumption continues to shift toward online purchases. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) said its research suggests independent releases remain under-represented on many download services, despite strong sales in traditional formats. “Independent music has long performed well in shops, and we want to see it compete on equal terms in digital retail,” said BPI chief executive Peter Jamieson. Digital single sales have now surpassed physical single purchases in the UK, widening the commercial stakes for labels without large marketing budgets. The BPI said it is in talks with leading providers, including iTunes and Napster, encouraging them to improve visibility for independent artists through featured placements and tailored recommendations. The organisation also noted that download purchases are expected to count toward the UK singles chart later this year, a change it described as likely to influence promotion strategies. As part of the programme, the BPI will host workshops for independent companies on distribution, rights management and online marketing. Similar chart rules have already been adopted in the United States.",ai,news
"Chart-leading British pop-rock trio Neon Avenue have confirmed they will pause group activities later this year, easing speculation that the band was preparing to split. In a statement released by their label, Horizon Records, the company said lead singer and guitarist Ryan Cole intends to devote the coming months to writing and touring with his side project, the heavier outfit Northbound. The label added that Neon Avenue members Cole, drummer Liam Hart and bassist Joel Mercer remain committed to returning to the studio “at a later stage”, though no timetable was announced.

Neon Avenue have been a regular fixture on the singles chart since breaking through in 2019, notching seven top-five releases, including three that reached number one. Their best-known tracks include First Period, Satellite Summer, Runaway Vows, Don’t Say Maybe and The Missing Name. The group’s self-titled debut album entered the top 10 on release, and its follow-up, All The Lights On, performed similarly the next year, helping to cement their reputation for bright hooks set against guitar-driven arrangements.

The band collected best pop act at last year’s National Music Awards and were nominated in the British group category. Most recently, they scored another chart-topper with their song Sky Rescue, recorded for the promotional campaign of a new big-screen action remake.

Industry observers have noted the group’s appeal among fans looking for radio-friendly pop that still foregrounds live instruments and songwriting credits. Recent reports had suggested Cole was considering stepping away to focus on Northbound, which is expected to announce tour dates shortly.",ai,news
"Newcastle manager Graeme Souness said he never sensed his side were on the verge of a shock exit as they progressed to the Uefa Cup last 16 after a 2-1 home win over Heerenveen sealed a 4-2 aggregate success. United struck quickly, benefiting from an early own goal before Alan Shearer doubled the advantage with a crisp finish, but the visitors responded after the interval to ensure a tense closing spell. “The first-leg result put us in a strong position,” Souness said. “When you score early it can make players think it’s already settled, and their goal reminded us we still had work to do.”

Shearer’s effort kept him closing in on Jackie Milburn’s long-standing club tally of 200 goals, leaving the striker a dozen short of the landmark. Souness played down suggestions the chase might influence Shearer’s plans, with the captain having indicated he expects to retire at the end of the campaign. “Records are nice, but I don’t think they decide a career,” he said. “If he’s enjoying it and feeling fit, that matters more.”

Souness also singled out winger Laurent Robert for praise, citing his delivery and willingness to drive at defenders as key to Newcastle’s most dangerous passages. “That’s the level we need from him regularly,” the manager added.",ai,news
"French household consumption edged up 1.4% in February, offering a modest boost to hopes of steadier economic momentum, according to data released on Tuesday by the national statistics office. The agency said spending was 3.5% higher than a year earlier, with stronger purchases of home appliances and other durable goods accounting for much of the monthly gain. Consumer prices, meanwhile, slipped 0.4% from January but were 1.7% above their level a year ago, pointing to easing short-term inflation pressures even as annual price growth remained firm. Not all sectors shared in the improvement: registrations of new cars declined 2.5% on the month after a small drop in January, though the market still posted a 6.1% increase compared with February last year. Economists said resilient household demand has been one of the main pillars of recent activity, but cautioned that the outlook remains exposed to external shocks. “Consumption can keep the economy afloat, but the pace is vulnerable to higher borrowing costs and renewed swings in energy prices,” said a Paris-based analyst. In neighboring Italy, a separate survey showed consumer sentiment rising to 104.1 from 103.0, its best reading since late autumn, despite softer expectations for the near term.",ai,news
"A survey of secondary school pupils has found widespread gaps in political awareness among teenagers, with many saying they do not see learning about parties and elections as a priority. In interviews conducted with 120 students aged 14 to 16 for an education report, fewer than one in three correctly identified which party currently leads the government and which forms the main opposition, while a similar proportion were unsure where the third-largest party sits. Most respondents could name the prime minister, but recognition of other senior figures was markedly lower, with fewer than two in 10 able to identify the opposition leader and only around one in 10 recognising the leader of a smaller national party. Several pupils also held mistaken views about which party is in office. The research also explored national identity, finding that the Union flag, traditional meals and familiar sporting events were the most commonly cited markers of Britishness. Many students described themselves primarily by their home nation, and references to a European identity were rare.",ai,news
"The competitive careers of Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou appear finished, according to the head of the national body that recently dropped domestic disciplinary findings over their alleged failure to attend a doping control. Addressing lawmakers in Athens, Greek Athletics Federation president Vassilli Sevastis said he does not expect either athlete to return to top-level racing, arguing that reputational harm has already undermined their prospects for sponsorship and participation. International officials are now weighing how to respond to the federation’s decision, while the two athletes also face proceedings in Greece’s criminal courts. Prosecutors have filed separate allegations linked to the missed test and claims that a reported motorcycle incident was staged to explain their absence. Sevastis told parliament that material provided by the International Olympic Committee and the sport’s global governing body did not, in his view, meet the threshold required for a guilty verdict under the federation’s procedures. He said the panel was asked to deliver a decisive outcome without being given documentation strong enough to support sanctions. Although the ruling leaves Kenteris and Thanou eligible to enter competitions pending any appeal, Sevastis maintained that further arbitration—even if it overturns the decision—would not restore their standing.",ai,news
"The first U.S. guilty pleas tied to large-scale copyright violations on a peer-to-peer file-sharing system have been entered, federal prosecutors said. Authorities identified the defendants as William Trowbridge of New York and Michael Chicoine of Texas, who admitted to participating in an online scheme that distributed copyrighted music, films and software without permission. The men face potential sentences of up to five years in prison and fines that can reach $250,000, according to the Department of Justice.

In court filings and a statement, prosecutors said the two helped run key “hub” servers used to coordinate a wider sharing community operating on the Direct Connect network, a platform that enables users to exchange files by connecting through centralized directories. Investigators allege the group, described by officials as an organized piracy ring, required members to make substantial collections available to others—ranging from small libraries to massive archives measured in gigabytes—in order to gain access.

Federal agents said they were able to obtain numerous copyrighted works directly from the network as part of the investigation, including feature films, commercial software, video games and music tracks, which officials characterized as evidence of a deliberate operation rather than casual sharing. The case grew out of a series of enforcement actions carried out in August, when the FBI executed search warrants at multiple locations linked to suspected online piracy activity.

The raids were part of an initiative known as Operation Digital Gridlock, aimed at dismantling networks accused of trafficking in pirated digital content. Prosecutors said both men pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement, and also acknowledged conduct intended to provide commercial benefit. Sentencing is scheduled for 29 April.",ai,news
"Climate change risks accelerating beyond manageable limits within the next few decades, Scotland’s environmental regulator has told MSPs as part of a parliamentary inquiry into the country’s readiness for a warmer, more volatile climate. Giving evidence to Holyrood’s environment committee, officials from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency said emissions from transport and energy continue to rise, and warned that existing policies may not cut greenhouse gases quickly enough. Witnesses argued that Scotland will likely need a mix of measures, including rapid expansion of renewable generation and continued use of low‑carbon baseload power, while broader efforts to curb demand are scaled up. 

Several contributors to the session said large onshore wind developments could become more common, bringing visible changes to rural landscapes, while investment in grid upgrades and storage would be required to maintain reliability. Others urged ministers to focus on reducing aviation within the UK and shifting more journeys onto electrified rail services, alongside cleaner buses and support for active travel. 

The committee also heard fresh analysis from marine researchers monitoring the Atlantic approaches to Scotland, who reported signs that severe weather could become more frequent and more damaging. Scientists involved in a multi‑institution study have been examining wave patterns and storm surges using satellite observations and buoy data collected over recent years, with a focus on the waters off the west coast and around the Hebrides. They told MSPs the findings align with projections of higher seas and stronger storms, increasing risks to coastal communities, infrastructure and fisheries.",ai,news
"Jennifer Lopez and her husband, singer Marc Anthony, are expected to share the stage for a joint performance at this month’s Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, organisers have confirmed. The couple, who married in 2004, will appear together during the 13 February broadcast in a duet that is already drawing attention as one of the night’s headline moments. Anthony, a Grammy winner with a long track record in Latin music, arrives at this year’s ceremony with multiple nominations, including recognition in Latin pop and tropical categories.

The show will also feature a special all-star version of The Beatles’ “Across the Universe,” performed by Bono, Stevie Wonder, Norah Jones and Brian Wilson, as part of a fundraising effort for victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami. A studio version of the track, which also includes contributions from Alicia Keys, Velvet Revolver and Tim McGraw, will be made available for purchase online, with proceeds directed toward relief initiatives. Fans will be able to buy the song through iTunes and access a companion video through CBS’s website.

Beyond the tribute, the telecast is set to include appearances by U2, Green Day, Keys and rapper Kanye West, who leads this year’s nominations with 10. West is slated to perform with John Legend, Mavis Staples and the Blind Boys of Alabama.

"Second seed Joachim Johansson claimed the Australian Hardcourt Championships in Adelaide on Sunday, defeating American Taylor Dent 7-5 6-3 to secure the second title of his professional career. The Swede was tested early as Dent fought off several chances to drop serve, saving three break points in a tense fifth game that kept the opening set on a knife edge. Johansson eventually found the decisive opening late in the set with an aggressive return that swung momentum, then tightened his baseline play to pull clear in the second. The victory follows his breakthrough tournament win in Memphis in 2004, a result that helped propel him from outside the top 100 into the upper tier of the rankings. Dent, despite the loss, said Johansson’s power game made him a serious threat for the Australian Open, which begins on 17 January, pointing in particular to his serving accuracy.

"Elena Dementieva defeated defending champion Venus Williams 6-3 6-2 on Sunday to capture the Champions Challenge exhibition title in Hong Kong. The sixth-ranked Russian took control early at Victoria Park, converting three breaks of serve in the opening set and limiting Williams’ opportunities on return. Williams briefly threatened a comeback by fighting off three match points, but Dementieva closed out the contest with steady baseline play and consistent serving. “It’s a positive way to begin the season, even if it’s not part of the regular tour,” Dementieva said, adding that the win would boost her confidence heading into the year’s major tournaments. Williams, 24, said she was frustrated by her level, citing a high number of unforced errors at key moments.

"The Manhattan recording complex where John Lennon worked on some of his last sessions is set to shut its doors in the coming weeks, marking the end of an era for one of New York’s best-known studios. The Hit Factory, a fixture of the city’s music scene for decades, built its reputation by hosting major acts across pop, rock and hip-hop, but operators say changing technology and shifting client demand have made the large facility increasingly difficult to sustain. The company plans to move operations to a smaller location in Miami, reflecting an industry-wide drift toward compact rooms and home-based production.

Lennon is among the studio’s most closely associated artists, having recorded material there for his comeback album “Double Fantasy” in the late 1970s. Founded in 1968 by songwriter and producer Jerry Ragovoy, the business later changed hands and expanded under producer Edward Germano into a multi-room complex offering recording, mixing and mastering services under one roof. Early sessions included work by Stevie Wonder, and the studio’s credits grew to encompass landmark projects such as Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A.,” the Rolling Stones’ “Emotional Rescue,” and Paul Simon’s “Graceland.” Over the years, artists ranging from Madonna and David Bowie to Jay-Z and Beyoncé booked time at the facility. In the mid-1990s, the studio reached a high-water mark when recordings completed there were linked to dozens of Grammy nominations in a single year, including music from “The Bodyguard” soundtrack.",ai,news
"EuroDisney, the Paris-area theme park operator, announced plans on Tuesday to raise about 255 million euros through a new share issue as it seeks to avert a cash crisis and complete a broader overhaul of its balance sheet. The offering forms the final stage of a debt restructuring aimed at addressing roughly 2.4 billion euros in liabilities accumulated since the resort opened in the early 1990s. Management said recent operating trends have improved, citing firmer attendance and higher ticket revenue, but market watchers remain cautious about whether the resort can sustain profitability once the refinancing measures are in place. The complex is still regarded as Europe’s biggest single tourist draw, with annual visitor numbers around 12 million, and has been expanding its entertainment lineup with a recently launched studio-themed park next to the main site. Shares in the company fell sharply in Paris trading following the announcement, as investors reacted to the dilution implied by the low offer price. The new stock will be taken up by the group’s two leading investors, including the US-based Disney parent and a Middle Eastern partner, according to the company.",ai,news
"A low-budget drama featuring actor Mark Ruffalo as a recently released sex offender took the festival’s top prize at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on Saturday, prompting debate over the decision. The film, titled *Second Chances*, received the Caledonia Grand Award, an honour named for pioneering Scottish filmmaker John Grierson. Directed by first-time feature director Lena Whitaker, the story follows a man attempting to re-enter society after a long prison sentence, while facing public hostility and strict supervision. In a statement, the jury said the film confronted a difficult subject with restraint and careful attention to the impact on victims and the wider community. Past recipients of the award include several titles that later found wider acclaim on the international circuit.

The festival also recognised emerging home-grown talent, presenting its UK New Voices prize to writer-director Saira Mahmood for her debut *Harbour Street*, set in Newcastle and centred on a young mother drawn into an escalating dispute with her immigrant neighbours. Separate honours from the International Critics’ Panel went to *Glass Steps*, a French-Belgian feature about disability and independence, while the festival’s first-film trophy was awarded to Canadian filmmaker Eli Navarro for the autobiographical collage *Static Days*.

The event concluded with a gala screening of the ensemble comedy *The Existentialists*, starring Paul Rudd and Frances McDormand, directed by indie veteran Martin Keene. This year’s line-up also included an early European showing of the latest animation from Studio Lumi and the UK premiere of the urban drama *Southside Boys*.",ai,news
"I’ll admit I went into this movie with a raised eyebrow. The idea of Danny DeVito being cast as a high-powered Wall Street predator sounds like a stunt on paper, and the romantic angle with Penelope Ann Miller is a stretch the film doesn’t fully justify. There’s also a missing layer: you can sense there’s history between certain characters that never quite gets unpacked.

That said, once it gets moving, it’s surprisingly fun and confident. DeVito doesn’t try to play the role “big”; he leans into his own presence and ends up feeling completely credible as a ruthless dealmaker with street instincts. By the middle, I wasn’t questioning it anymore—I was buying the whole persona.

The supporting cast helps a lot. Dean Jones brings a weary, pragmatic energy that grounds the corporate scheming, and Gregory Peck delivers the kind of steady, authoritative performance you expect from him. Flaws aside, it’s an entertaining watch.",ai,reviews
"This isn’t the kind of film you’d automatically associate with Kitano if you only know him for sudden brutality or tough-guy cool. That contrast is exactly why it works. Here he steps back from the spotlight and lets the mood do the heavy lifting. The rhythm is deliberately unhurried, with long stretches where very little “happens” in the conventional sense, yet it never feels empty. It’s more like watching someone think.

The story follows a man trying to keep his everyday obligations from crushing what he actually cares about—work, art, and the complicated gravity of romance pulling in different directions. It quietly asks whether ambition is a gift or a trap, and whether hope survives routine.

If you’re patient with slow cinema, the payoff is subtle but lingering.",ai,reviews
"I picked this up as part of a multi-disc compilation of classic Jolly Frolics cartoons, and it ended up being one of the more memorable entries. A quick heads-up: there are light plot details below. This installment in the Ham and Hattie run is essentially two bite-sized cartoons stitched together with music, which makes it feel like a mini program rather than a single short.

The first segment follows Hattie as she fusses over a little sailboat in a fountain. It’s simple, charming, and driven more by rhythm and visuals than dialogue, with a small mishap that’s resolved thanks to a helpful authority figure.

The second piece shifts gears to a small-town ensemble that’s treated like background noise—until an important guest is on the way and suddenly everyone needs a band. The turnaround is funny and a bit pointed. Overall, the set is a great purchase, and this pairing is an easy recommendation.",ai,reviews
"Scary Movie feels like it’s making fun of the exact thing that drives me crazy in most slashers: characters surviving only because they keep choosing the worst possible option. The opening bit nails that point immediately—our “victim” has chances to grab something useful, and instead goes for the most ridiculous item imaginable. It’s not scary, but it’s a perfect jab at how horror scripts force people to act brain-dead just to keep the plot moving.

What surprised me is how committed the cast is. The Wayans, Anna Faris, and the rest lean into the overacting and cheesy line delivery like they’re channeling every forgettable teen thriller from the 90s. If you’ve just sat through a serious horror movie that annoyed you, this is a great palate cleanser.",ai,reviews
"I’ve been dipping back into 90s action lately, and this one came recommended as one of Jean-Claude Van Damme’s tighter, more suspenseful outings. The setup is simple but effective: Darren McCord is an ex-firefighter carrying heavy guilt from a past rescue gone wrong, now trying to be a steady dad to his two kids. He takes them to a big hockey playoff game, expecting a fun night out—only for the arena to become the perfect trap when a ruthless gang, led by a greedy mastermind, seizes high-profile hostages in a luxury suite.

What I liked most is how quickly the film gets moving. Van Damme plays McCord as more worn-down and determined than invincible, and the confined arena setting keeps the tension high without feeling repetitive. The villain is also surprisingly memorable, with enough personality to make the standoffs enjoyable.

It’s not deep cinema, but it’s a solid, crowd-pleasing action thriller with decent pacing, clear stakes, and a few genuinely exciting moments.",ai,reviews
"I sat down to watch this film mainly because I’d enjoyed the lead actor in a much better action flick and figured he could carry another project. Big mistake. Whatever charm and intensity he had elsewhere gets wasted here on a movie that can’t decide what story it’s telling. Scenes stumble along like they belong to different scripts, and the characters are either thinly drawn or downright irritating. A certain supporting actress I usually find grating only makes it harder to stay engaged. By the halfway point I was checking the time and wondering how something this muddled made it past editing. I borrowed it, thankfully, but it still felt like I’d overpaid.",ai,reviews
"I grew up thinking 20/20 was the gold standard for TV news magazines. When Barbara Walters and Hugh Downs were in the anchor chairs, the program felt like it had a purpose: digging into shady businesses, tracking down con artists, and doing the kind of reporting that actually made you feel a little smarter (and safer) as a viewer. The undercover segments were the highlight for me, and Stossel’s commentary pieces had a bite to them that you didn’t see anywhere else.

Somewhere along the way, that edge disappeared. After Downs left, the pacing and tone started to shift, and once Walters was gone too it felt like the last connection to what made the show special had been cut. These days, it seems like 20/20 leans heavily on stories that have already been beaten to death online, or it drifts into celebrity-adjacent fluff that could’ve aired anywhere. Even the “investigations” often feel like lightweight myth-testing instead of real accountability journalism.

It’s disappointing, because the show used to feel essential. Now it mostly feels like filler dressed up as a news program.",ai,reviews
"I picked up this movie mostly for Virginie Ledoyen, who I’ve enjoyed in other roles, and partly out of curiosity about Olivier Assayas behind the camera. Going in, I expected something sharper and more emotionally grounded than what I got, but I can’t say it left me cold, either.

Nearly everyone here feels wrapped up in their own reflection. Gabriel, played by Mathieu Amalric, is especially hard to take: he craves attention like oxygen, yet shuts down the moment anyone suggests he change course. The story drifts around Adrien, a novelist hovering at the edge of real life, writing books that seem to vanish the moment they’re finished. Most of the group is the same—underemployed, under-motivated, and oddly comfortable with drifting.

What kept me watching wasn’t the plot so much as the performances and the uneasy truthfulness of the mood. It’s not a film I’d rush to revisit, but the cast makes the aimlessness oddly watchable.",ai,reviews
"I still can’t believe how little recognition this film got at the big awards. It deserved far more than just a nod for the lead actor. In my opinion it easily should have been in the race for best picture, and the soundtrack alone warranted major attention. The songs are genuinely memorable, especially “Aana Mere Pyar Ko Na Tum” and “Woh To Hai Albela,” which I can still hum without thinking.

What really lifts the movie is that it’s based on a true story, and that emotional core comes through. Shah Rukh Khan carries the whole thing with charm and sincerity; you buy his struggles and his stubborn hope. Without him, I doubt the film would have worked the same way, because the supporting cast is fine but not extraordinary.

The relationship angle, the effort to earn approval, and the light romantic comedy moments blend surprisingly well. Not his absolute best, but definitely one of his strongest romantic outings for me. 10/10.",ai,reviews
"Mirror, Mirror (1990) is the kind of bargain-bin horror that makes me wonder what my younger self was thinking. I put it on expecting cheesy fun, but it mostly left me irritated. The setup sounds like it should work: a lonely high school girl (Rainbow Harvest) finds an antique mirror and starts using it as an escape from her miserable social life. Of course the mirror isn’t just a mirror—it feeds her anger and offers a shortcut to payback.

The problem is the movie never earns its big moments. The bullying feels cartoonish, the scares are weak, and the “power with a price” angle is handled in the bluntest way possible. When the mirror starts changing her, it’s more goofy than unsettling, and the pacing drags whenever it should be ramping up.

I’m genuinely confused why this got a nice home release; it’s not a hidden gem, it’s just messy. If you love it, I’d honestly like to hear the appeal. I won’t be revisiting it. Not recommended.",ai,reviews
"The Coens open with that familiar “this really happened” tease, then spend the rest of the film gleefully yanking the rug out from under you. Jerry Lundegaard, a small-time dealership guy with big-time desperation, thinks he can solve his money problems by arranging his wife’s abduction and squeezing a ransom from his towering father-in-law. Naturally, the two crooks he hires are a catastrophic pair—more clueless than calculating—and what starts as a scheme quickly mutates into a trail of bad decisions and sudden violence.

Enter Marge Gunderson, a sharp, very pregnant police chief whose calm decency makes the surrounding chaos even stranger. The movie balances bleakness with deadpan humor in a way that feels effortless. The snowy visuals are pristine, the characters are memorably odd, and Macy’s jittery performance is painfully perfect. Dark, funny, and unsettling all at once.",ai,reviews
"I’m with a lot of the other reviewers on this one: it doesn’t get nearly the attention it deserves. I usually gravitate toward big historical dramas, but this movie hooked me for a different reason—it’s less about the headlines and more about watching a deeply troubled person unravel from the inside out. Even if you couldn’t care less about the political backdrop, the character study is gripping and surprisingly intimate.

The acting across the board is phenomenal, with the women in particular bringing a lot of heartbreak and quiet strength to their roles. I also have to give major credit to the director’s bold style choices; the film swings for the fences and somehow stays coherent and compelling. I enjoy a few of his other well-known titles, but this is the one that feels the most daring and fully realized.",ai,reviews
"Somehow this so-called family film keeps popping up on my TV, and every time I catch a few minutes I’m amazed it got released at all. The plot feels like a half-baked joke that spiraled into a screenplay during a late-night hangout, and the execution doesn’t do it any favors. It’s marketed for kids, yet it tosses in a bizarre “danger” subplot that’s both unsettling and never properly accounted for. The canine lead is supposed to carry the charm, but the dog looks confused, and the human cast isn’t much more convincing. Visually, it resembles a community theater project shot behind someone’s shed, complete with a “big” sports finale where the crowd could fit in a small classroom. Then it limps to the finish with narration that screams, “We ran out of money.”",ai,reviews
"Older films can be weirdly underrated, and this spy farce is one of those cases. It’s definitely not prestige cinema, but it’s an easy, entertaining watch with a surprisingly busy plot. The story follows Jeff and Jane Blue, a married pair of agents who’ve just had a baby and are supposed to be on a break. Naturally, their “leave” turns into a job when an old superior pulls them back in for one last assignment in New Orleans. Their goal is more about nudging a shady Eastern European weapons seller into making a mistake than blasting their way through the city, which keeps things light and comedic.

What makes it fun is how many people are chasing the same tail at once. Two determined cops start sniffing around after Jeff interferes in a street crime, and a small-time hood with a bruised ego decides he needs payback too. Watching all these groups unknowingly trip over each other is the best part.

It’s also a neat time capsule of pre-Katrina New Orleans. Harder to track down than it should be, but worth it if you find it.",ai,reviews
"A quartet of officers assigned to keep a key witness alive are taken out in a swift, brutal ambush led by hired gun Wanda and her crew. With his racketeering trial suddenly wobbling, prosecutor Daniel Graham fumes and races to replace the vanished testimony before mob chief Rusty Pirone walks. Meanwhile, Valerie Alston, a single mom serving on the jury, finds herself leaned on by Tommy Vesey, a former cop turned enforcer who knows exactly where to apply pressure.

As a crime thriller, it’s pretty standard stuff—ticking-clock tension, courtroom stakes, and familiar betrayals. What keeps it watchable is the cast: Quinlan brings an edge to an offbeat part, and Hurt clearly enjoys playing nasty. Whalley doesn’t always land the emotional beats, but overall it’s a serviceable, forgettable genre entry.",ai,reviews
"THE CRYSTAL VILLAGE is yet another bargain-bin kids’ fantasy adventure with that unmistakable low-budget charm, reportedly filmed overseas with a tiny crew and a lot of enthusiasm. The hook is familiar: two curious siblings stumble onto a miniature civilization trapped inside a glowing artifact, and before long they’re dodging booby traps, navigating toy-sized streets, and trying to keep the place from being wiped out by a cranky band of interdimensional raiders. The plot is mostly silly, but it barrels forward so confidently that you end up going with it. The creature makeup is a hoot—very “late-night sci‑fi TV” in the best way—and the sets, while clearly modest, have a handmade ingenuity. There’s also a surprisingly early appearance from a now-recognizable young actor.",ai,reviews
"Coming from a beloved stage story and an even better classic film, this remake looked like a sure thing. Charming leads? Check. A filmmaker who’s done sharp, witty work before? Check. It should’ve been an easy win for a warm, modern rom-com. Instead it feels smug, mechanical, and weirdly low-energy, as if everyone assumed the premise alone would carry it. The banter is flat, the plot hits every beat you see coming from miles away, and the “heart” arrives on schedule rather than naturally. If you’re hoping for the sparkle and snap of top-tier romantic comedy, you’ll end up frustrated. The only thing with real passion here is the relentless brand shilling. Save your time and watch the older version instead.",ai,reviews
"This movie wants you to believe the skinhead crew has some kind of code, but every scene screams “train wreck with boots.” The hangout vibe is pure menace mixed with idiot bravado—like watching toddlers play gangster with real consequences. The casual cruelty is what gets me: one minute they’re talking loyalty, the next they’re dumping a “friend” like trash the second he’s inconvenient. And the big plans? Half-baked math, zero foresight, and a whole lot of “nobody will notice us” while looking like the most noticeable people on earth.

There are a few darkly funny moments—guys nodding off with a book in hand, tough talk collapsing into instant surrender—but the laughs are bitter. By the end, Hando’s not some legend; he’s just a lonely, angry mess watching his world evaporate.",ai,reviews
"This softly observant film follows a young boy growing up with his family in northern England during the 1950s, and it feels deeply personal, as if the director is carefully paging through his own memories. What stays with you most is the craftsmanship: the imagery is luminous without calling attention to itself, and the sound design is used like a form of storytelling. Snatches of period music drift in and out, and familiar voices from classic cinema echo through the boy’s everyday world, blurring the line between lived experience and what’s playing on the screen. One extended sequence glides above classrooms, pews, and rows of seats in a picture house, and it’s hypnotic—ordinary routines becoming almost sacred. The movie ultimately makes a convincing case for cinema as refuge, ritual, and revelation.",ai,reviews
"This film is a slick, steamy teen melodrama that never really lets up. The dialogue is blunt, the situations are deliberately provocative, and the story moves quickly from one temptation to the next. A restless, privileged girl pushes her cocky stepbrother—famous for keeping “scores”—into a cruel challenge: prove he can seduce an innocent, deeply religious classmate before the new term begins. The stakes are outrageous and personal, and watching the scheme unfold is equal parts entertaining and uncomfortable. He even detours with a naïve, bubbly friend who becomes another notch in his belt, until the game turns on him and real feelings complicate everything. The supporting adults add bite and dark humor, rounding out the scandalous fun.",ai,reviews
"This film feels less like a story and more like a long wink to people who already know the industry gossip. There’s technically a plot in there somewhere, but it’s so flimsy that it mostly exists to shuttle you from one famous face to the next. A cameo can be a fun surprise; fifty of them in a row turns into a distraction. After a while I wasn’t reacting to the jokes, I was doing mental trivia: “Wait… is that actually them, or are they supposed to be some fictional version of themselves?” That gets old fast, and it starts to muddy scenes that should have some emotional weight.

I will say the lead performance kept me watching longer than I expected. It’s refreshing to see a solid actor actually carry a movie instead of being used for two minutes of recognition bait. Still, the script asks you to ignore some truly ridiculous logic—moments where a character would have to be blind, deaf, and incurious not to notice what’s happening right in front of them.

I understand why people admire it: it’s trying to say something about Hollywood. But ambition doesn’t automatically equal entertainment.",ai,reviews
"“54” sets out to capture the myth of Studio 54, the late-70s playground for celebrities, beautiful people, and anyone chasing a velvet-rope fantasy. Ryan Phillippe plays a wide-eyed newcomer who gets swept up in the club’s glare, loosely echoing real staffers from that era. The trouble is, the movie confuses excess for insight. It’s drenched in neon, sweat, and pop soundtrack swagger, but it rarely digs into what that lifestyle costs the people living it.

You can feel it reaching for the sharp, unflinching bite of a darker showbiz exposé, yet it never commits, bouncing between scandal, romance, and cautionary tale without landing on any of them. Mike Myers, as the volatile owner, is stuck in a half-serious part that doesn’t give him much room to surprise. In the end, it’s more pose than punch—and not much fun, either.",ai,reviews
"Let me lay it out: I’m a huge movie fan, and Toy Story is still a near-perfect classic. But the 3-D re-release? It felt like paying a cover charge to walk into my own living room. I kept waiting for that “wow” moment where depth actually adds something, and it barely showed up. Most scenes looked exactly like the regular version, only dimmer, with the occasional bit of separation that disappears as soon as you notice it. 

What really stings is the upcharge. Not only are you buying a ticket for a film you probably already own, you’re also paying extra for the glasses, as if the experience is somehow premium. If you’ve seen Toy Story before, you’re not getting a fresh take—just a pricier replay. Save your money.",ai,reviews
"This is a movie about the messy, funny, occasionally exhausting reality of making a movie. It follows a single day on a shoestring set, where every problem is solved with duct tape, stubbornness, and a little luck. More than a plot-driven story, it’s a love letter to the people who keep indie productions alive—crew members juggling roles, actors waiting around, and a director trying to hold everything together. The style feels confidently minimalist, with some striking monochrome moments that give it an art-house vibe without feeling precious. The cameos are a treat, too, and the performances sell the chaos. If you’ve never cared how films get made, it may drag. If you have, it’s delightful.",ai,reviews
"To start, I’d call this talk show decent, even though I definitely haven’t watched every single episode. When it’s on, I usually find myself sticking around for a while, and I can even hum parts of the opening music from memory. Not every subject they dive into interests me, and some segments feel a bit drawn out. That said, I like when the host takes on the more heated, uncomfortable issues and keeps the conversation moving. The best moments are when guests actually reflect and you can see real changes happening by the end—those episodes are surprisingly satisfying. Overall, it’s not perfect, but it’s memorable. If it ever pops up in reruns, longtime fans should try to catch it again before it disappears completely.",ai,reviews
"A gently witty comedy-drama from northern China, this film follows Ermo, a fiercely proud noodle seller who pushes herself to exhaustion with one clear goal: outdoing her better-off neighbors by buying the largest television around. The premise is simple, yet the story keeps finding small, revealing moments—arguments in cramped rooms, the bustle of the market, and a tender, awkward connection with a man who already has a family. That thread lands in an interesting place, sometimes played for laughs, sometimes unexpectedly moving. Performances feel natural rather than showy, and the director’s careful compositions make everyday life look quietly purposeful. It doesn’t race or aim for big climaxes, but the steady craftsmanship and human warmth linger after it ends.",ai,reviews
"I’ll be honest: the pacing drags here and there, and a few jokes feel like they’re trying a little too hard to be “family friendly.” But once the story settles in, it turns into a surprisingly heartfelt look at growing up and realizing the world doesn’t stay the same just because you want it to. The film really nails that awkward transition from being the kid who dominated in youth leagues to suddenly being surrounded by bigger, faster, more polished players—especially in a new school environment where confidence doesn’t automatically carry over.

What hit me most was the emotional thread between the team and their former mentor. The main character’s sense of being left behind feels raw, and it adds weight to what could’ve been a standard sports sequel. By the end, it’s less about trophies and more about choosing who you want to be when the safety net disappears.

And the standout scene? That quiet talk about leadership and responsibility. It’s genuinely memorable.",ai,reviews
"I went into Sphere with really low expectations after seeing all the mediocre IMDb scores, and it ended up completely winning me over. The pacing keeps shifting in a way that constantly throws you off balance, and just when you think you’ve figured out what’s happening, it veers somewhere else. People love to complain about how it wraps up, but honestly, the finale is what sealed it for me—it’s bold and unsettling in the best way. I’ve rewatched it more times than I’d like to admit, and it somehow stays tense even when you know the beats. I can see why it won’t click for everyone, and maybe my first watch caught me in the perfect mood, but I’m unapologetically obsessed with this movie.",ai,reviews
"SHADOW STRIKE is a low-rent action movie from the late ’80s that never really comes together. It’s obviously trying to capture the breezy, macho energy of TV hits of the time, all dirt bikes, explosions, and tough-guy banter, but the script feels patched together and the performances are stiff. The first stretch plays like a melodramatic home-life subplot that drags on far too long before the plot finally shifts into gear: a woman gets snatched, and the lead charges in as a one-man rescue squad. To be fair, a few of the practical set pieces are surprisingly bold considering the thin resources, yet they land with little impact because the story gives you no reason to care.",ai,reviews
"This movie follows Selena as she chases the life she’s always wanted. From the start, you can tell she’s determined, and her voice is treated like something truly special. I liked how the story didn’t only focus on the music, but also showed her making bold choices, like marrying the man she loved even though her father didn’t approve. My favorite section was when she stepped into fashion and started building something of her own outside of performing. The hardest moment to watch was the betrayal that led to her being shot by someone she trusted. That scene was heartbreaking and stayed with me. Even with the sadness, I thought the film was really well done, and I’d watch it again.",ai,reviews
"I came to Columbia’s Fox & Crow shorts with low expectations, mostly because the tie-in comics never did much for me. This episode changed my mind. The anxious, high-strung Fox is obsessed with collecting eggs, and the Crow ends up guarding two precious ones as if they’re dependents he can’t abandon. Rather than fight him head-on, the Crow steers the whole situation into a stage routine, nudging the Fox into a makeshift vaudeville partnership that’s doomed from the first cue.  

The animation isn’t as lush as the studio’s earlier work; you can see the cost-cutting in the simpler designs and cleaner backgrounds. Still, the timing is sharp, the dialogue keeps things moving, and the slapstick escalates in a satisfying way. The characters’ personalities carry the comedy, and the ending lands with the kind of playful sting these shorts do best.",ai,reviews
"Alright, I’ll admit I’m biased: give me a slick French action flick and I’m already halfway sold. But this one actually earns it. Instead of drowning every moment in moody speeches and circular arguing, it keeps the dialogue tight and lets the chase do the talking. The pacing is the real surprise—scenes don’t linger until they go stale, and the tension stays high without feeling like the director is showing off.

What I appreciated most is how the main driver isn’t turned into a generic trigger-happy hero. When things go sideways, he doesn’t default to guns or fistfights like a typical big-studio thriller. He wins by thinking like a speed addict, using timing and nerve to stay a step ahead of the thieves. Fast, lean, and way more fun than expected.",ai,reviews
"I honestly had a blast with this movie. Is it a little corny? Absolutely. But that’s part of why it works so well. The pace is quick, the jokes keep coming, and I can’t think of many scenes that drag. I’ve seen people call it “stupid” or “messy,” but I think they’re missing the point—it’s meant to be wild, ridiculous fun, and it delivers.

The whole hotel setup is perfect, because every door that opens seems to unleash a new kind of chaos. I kept thinking, “There’s no way it can get worse for this guy,” and then it somehow does. The poor bellhop gets tossed into one insane situation after another, like the universe decided his first shift should be a survival test. If that were my first night on the job, I’d be out the door immediately.

Watch it with friends if you can. The shared laughter makes the over-the-top moments even better, and you’ll probably end up quoting it afterward.",ai,reviews
"I’m usually not the target audience for animated musicals, so I hesitated before watching this, but a friend insisted and the glowing online scores made it sound like a safe bet. Honestly, I came away feeling duped. The story takes a respected Chinese tale and dresses it up with modern, jokey attitudes that don’t fit the setting at all. The heroine often comes off like she wandered in from a teen sitcom, and the wisecracking dragon sidekick never stops mugging for attention. Songs pop up at awkward moments and aren’t memorable, the humor relies on clumsy pratfalls, and every “twist” is visible miles ahead. Even with kids in the room, I doubt it would land. 5/10.",ai,reviews
"In this installment of the Famous Studios series, Katnip is stuck pulling the late shift as a store guard at Stacy’s, only to stumble on Herman and his pals turning the toy section into their personal playground. Herman’s solution is suitably sneaky: he tries to persuade Katnip that he’s losing his marbles, and the cat’s mounting panic drives most of the laughs. The department store backdrop works wonderfully, since every aisle becomes a setup—furniture displays, gadgets, and kids’ toys all get pressed into service. Nothing feels groundbreaking, but the timing is tight and the elastic cartoon expressions keep the routine gags lively.",ai,reviews
"I came away from this one feeling slightly baffled, as if I’d sat through a lads’ in-joke that forgot other people might be in the room. It’s steeped in that cosy myth of the endearing, flawed man-child: the fellas get all the texture and forgiveness, while the women mostly exist to be admired or to provide a convenient emotional mirror. The lead actress does what she can with the material and looks fantastic doing it, but the character is written more like an aspiration than a person you might actually meet.

What surprised me most was how half-hearted the “sporting” side felt. For something that leans so hard on football as atmosphere, the match moments are oddly generic—roars, slumps, rinse and repeat—without the specificity that makes it ring true.

By the end it tips into moody, self-regarding wistfulness that thinks it’s profound, when it’s really just damp and a bit adolescent. If you want something in the same orbit but sharper and more balanced, there are better choices.",ai,reviews
"This is the movie that really cemented Jim Carrey as a must-watch comedy star for me. Even after seeing his earlier hits, this one feels like the perfect mix of wild physical humor and a surprisingly sincere heart. The premise is simple but brilliant: a slick attorney who bends the truth for a living suddenly can’t tell a single lie for 24 hours thanks to his kid’s birthday wish. Watching him try to navigate court, coworkers, and his own messy personal life without his usual shortcuts is nonstop chaos in the best way. Carrey plays Fletcher Reede with incredible energy, but he also lets the character’s regret and vulnerability show through when it counts. By the end, it’s not just funny—it lands an honest message about showing up for your family and being truthful with the people who trust you most.",ai,reviews
"If you’re looking for an older vampire movie that still hits hard, this one is a blast. For something made back in the mid-90s, it delivers a surprisingly solid plot and keeps the tension going without getting boring. The cast sells it too—nobody feels like they’re just reading lines, and the characters actually make you care who lives. The effects hold up better than I expected, especially in the darker scenes where most films from that era look cheap. I’ve seen a lot of vampire stuff, and this ranks near the top for pure spooky fun. The rating it gets online feels a little low to me. I’d give it a strong 9/10. If this doesn’t creep you out, you might be impossible to scare.",ai,reviews
"Cynthia Rothrock shows up, looks great, and throws hands like she was born doing it. Unfortunately, that’s basically the movie’s entire game plan. This is bargain-bin late-night cable fodder: cheap sets, awkward acting, and a script that feels like it was scribbled during a commercial break. The director also seems oddly interested in lingering on sweaty dudes more than anything else, which gives the whole thing a weird vibe. The action is serviceable when Cynthia’s on screen, and the finale goes for a nasty shock moment that at least wakes you up. But the hyperactive cutting and nonstop noise can’t hide how empty it is. If you’re a die-hard martial arts junkie, maybe. Everyone else: pick a classic instead.",ai,reviews
"I grew up reading The Phantom, that endlessly rebooted jungle myth where the mask gets passed down and the “Ghost Who Walks” keeps punching criminals into the dirt. So when I finally sat down to watch the film, I was honestly excited just to see that world on screen.

The first thing the movie gets right is the period vibe. Setting it in the late ’30s gives it an old-serial flavor that fits the character, and the production design does a decent job selling the pulpy, globe-trotting adventure. A couple of the supporting performances help too; there are moments when the cast almost convinces you you’re watching a classic matinee romp.

But the problems pile up fast. The dialogue feels stiff and rushed, like nobody had time to make it sound like real people talking. Worse, the tone keeps wobbling between camp and serious action, so scenes that should build tension end up landing flat. The lead isn’t terrible, but he never fully becomes that legendary figure the comics promised.

There are a handful of fun sequences and a few atmospheric shots, yet overall it’s the kind of movie you put on for a lazy afternoon and barely remember a week later.",ai,reviews
"I just got home from watching Bad Boys II and I’m still pumped. It’s one of those movies that keeps throwing action at you, but it never forgets to be funny. Even though it runs close to two and a half hours, it honestly flew by because something is always happening—chases, shootouts, and plenty of back-and-forth between the leads.

What really impressed me was how real a lot of it felt. You can tell they relied more on practical stunts than shiny computer effects. When cars get wrecked, they look truly wrecked, and the big destruction scenes have that heavy, “this actually happened” feel instead of looking like a video game cutscene.

I liked the first Bad Boys a lot, but this one feels bigger and a little wilder. I’ve seen some low ratings and I don’t get it. For me it’s easily a strong 4 stars. I’m definitely buying it the day it hits DVD.",ai,reviews
"I usually roll my eyes at formulaic action flicks, but this one surprised me. It knows exactly what it is and leans into the silliness without trying too hard, which made it way more enjoyable than I expected. The dialogue has a few smart quips that actually landed, and the pacing rarely drags. For a movie that clearly wasn’t made with a massive wallet, the effects and stunts are better than they have any right to be—nothing groundbreaking, but solid and polished. I only gave it a shot because I grabbed it cheap at a discount rack, and I’m happy I did. Worth a casual watch, just don’t go in expecting a masterpiece.",ai,reviews
"Brian De Palma is one of those directors I admire and argue with in the same breath. When he’s on, he’s electrifying; when he’s not, you can feel the machinery turning. “Carlito’s Way” sits right in that uneasy middle ground for me. On the surface it presents itself as a fairly standard gangster comeback story: a man gets out of prison, swears off the old life, and tries to go straight. But the film keeps tightening the screws until that promise feels less like a choice and more like a trap.

Al Pacino gives Carlito a weary warmth that makes you want to believe in him, even when his instincts keep dragging him back toward danger. Sean Penn, twitchy and slick as the lawyer friend, is a perfect catalyst for disaster. Where the movie stumbles is in how it sometimes romanticizes Carlito’s “inevitable” slide; a few turns feel staged for maximum operatic tension rather than earned behavior.

Still, De Palma’s set pieces are staged with real precision, and the final stretch is both clever and cruel. I just wish the emotional fallout hit as hard as the technique.",ai,reviews
"Honestly, I didn’t expect to enjoy this one as much as I did. I’ve never been totally sold on Keanu as a powerhouse actor, but he really holds his own here, and it works. “The Devil’s Advocate” is a slick, entertaining thriller with a stacked cast that brings serious energy to every scene. The story keeps escalating in a way that’s wild but still easy to follow, and the visuals and atmosphere are surprisingly strong for its time. I’m also shocked the score isn’t higher—this movie goes for it and delivers. Definitely worth a watch. 9/10",ai,reviews
"This film definitely won’t click with everyone; if you need big plot twists or constant action, you’ll probably wonder why people rave about it. It takes an ordinary couple dynamic and compresses years of routine, petty arguments, and affection into a single day, all delivered with a perfectly flat, razor-dry sense of humor. The script is the real star—every line feels carefully timed, understated, and oddly satisfying. Side characters pop in just long enough to sharpen the satire, and the movie nails the small, familiar stereotypes without feeling mean. If you’re tuned into that vibe, it’s hilarious.",ai,reviews
"The creature makeup and practical effects are a blast, and the plot holds together surprisingly well. The ensemble cast clicks, and most of the characters are easy to root for, even if a couple of their choices feel a little forced. What I liked most is how it balances tones: it genuinely made me laugh in spots, then turned around and got tense and creepy without warning. The pacing stays lively, with enough action to keep things moving while still sprinkling in a fun “who’s infected?” kind of suspense. The build-up to the big “queen” reveal is worth it—such a memorable design. If you enjoy alien takeover thrillers like Body Snatchers-style paranoia, this is a solid pick. 9/10.",ai,reviews
"I’ve gone back to this series again and again, and it still makes me laugh out loud. I’m a longtime fan of the original show, but this follow-up feels a bit fresher to me, probably because I haven’t worn it out with endless rewatches. It builds nicely on the idea of the staff’s shared pension money and drops everyone into a new situation that creates plenty of chaos without losing the spirit of what came before. The newcomers fit in surprisingly well, with great comic timing and just the right amount of eccentricity. The actress playing Mavis is an absolute highlight, and Miss Lovelock steals scenes with her perfect deadpan. Mavis’s dad is also a riot. The country-house setting is gorgeous—honestly, I’d love a weekend there. My only complaint: there aren’t enough episodes.",ai,reviews
"MANNY & LO (2 outta 5 stars)  
Not exactly terrible… just feels like it’s trying really hard to be quirky and heartfelt, then sort of forgets where it’s going. The setup is solid: two sisters with no adults to lean on hit the road to avoid getting split up by the system, and the older one’s pregnancy hangs over everything like a ticking clock. When they snatch a woman from a baby supply shop to help them figure out what to do, the movie shifts into this odd little hostage-turned-family scenario in a remote cabin.

There are moments that genuinely work, especially once the three start connecting in a way that’s more sad than cute. But the script leans on shocky language and random outbursts, and it undercuts what could’ve been a surprisingly tender story. The younger sister is played by a very young Scarlett Johansson, and she’s easily the most convincing person on screen. Mary Kay Place is also a strong anchor. Still, by the end it’s entertaining enough, just not very satisfying.",ai,reviews
"Christopher Lambert and Christopher Lloyd turn up in an under-the-radar caper comedy where they play a pair of not-so-bright jewel thieves who snag the wrong gem and trigger absolute chaos. From there it’s one mistaken identity after another, with multiple shady factions converging to reclaim the stone, each more desperate than the last. The humor is mostly light and breezy, landing a few solid laughs without ever going for anything too edgy. What really sells it is the rapport between the leads: Lloyd is especially fun as the eccentric, seasoned crook, and Lambert proves he can handle comedic timing better than people give him credit for. That said, the script is uneven and some bits fall flat. Still, the finale ties things together nicely. 7/10.",ai,reviews
"I honestly can’t believe I sat through this. I put it on expecting a halfway respectable gothic thriller, maybe even something that nodded to the big-name vampire and monster films it tries to resemble in the title and cover art. Nope. What I got was a bargain-bin creature feature that feels like it was assembled from leftover sets, stock music, and pure confidence.

The dialogue lands with a thud, and the actors deliver every line like they’re auditioning for a soap opera set inside a haunted museum. Scenes that should build tension instead drag on, stuffed with dramatic pauses and ominous staring. If anything could salvage this, it would be a commentary track by people who know how to turn cinematic disasters into entertainment—because unintentional comedy is the strongest element here.

The one moment I’ll remember is the big “reveal” of the ancient wrapped-up monster. The camera lingers like it’s showing off award-worthy makeup, and that’s when you notice the detail nobody bothered to fix: the hand looks… wrong. Not “uncanny,” just plainly incorrect, like the prop department grabbed whatever was closest and hoped no one would look too closely. I looked. Regrets.",ai,reviews
"I don’t care how many people call this movie “essential” or “brilliant”—what’s on screen is indefensible. There’s an extended sequence where a clearly terrified cat is manhandled for minutes, tossed around, restrained, and then deliberately made to ingest something implied to be lethal. It isn’t quick, it isn’t implied off-camera, and it isn’t a trick of editing; the camera lingers while the animal goes limp. That alone should be enough to disqualify any talk of artistic merit.

What makes it even worse is that the cruelty is carried out by a young child performer. Watching a kid be directed to terrorize and potentially kill an animal for a shot is nauseating, and the movie treats it as just another scene.

If this had come from a celebrated Western auteur, it would be condemned without hesitation. The praise says more about critics than it does about the film.",ai,reviews
"I’ve always had a soft spot for *Newsies*, and this DVD reminded me why it’s such a fun watch. It’s a family-friendly musical inspired by real events from the 1890s, and it manages to be both entertaining and surprisingly meaningful. If you enjoy big, energetic song-and-dance scenes, you’ll probably be hooked fast—the choreography is lively and the ensemble numbers have a lot of momentum. A few of the songs still get stuck in my head, especially the ones where the newsboys rally together and dream about something better.

Even if musicals aren’t usually your thing, there’s still plenty to appreciate. It gives a cleaned-up but effective glimpse of old New York and highlights how tough life could be for working kids, including themes like exploitation, poverty, and kids without families trying to get by. It’s also a classic “little guy vs. powerful tycoon” story, which makes it easy to root for the characters.

Not everything moves at the same pace—some of the boardroom-style scenes feel slower—but overall it’s a solid, rewatchable movie that can spark good conversations.",ai,reviews
"Woody Allen’s *Shadows and Fog* feels less like a conventional movie and more like a stage farce dressed in moody, black‑and‑white Expressionist clothing. It borrows the look and anxious spirit of early German cinema, with echoes of Kafka-esque bureaucracy where everyone talks around the point. Allen plays a jittery everyman yanked out of bed by a self-important vigilante crowd and pushed into a manhunt with no clear instructions, which is where most of the humor lands. Meanwhile Mia Farrow’s weary circus performer drifts into her own misadventures, including an unexpectedly transactional romance that’s both funny and a little sad. The plot wanders and the ending doesn’t quite pay off, but the atmosphere and quick comic beats make it an enjoyable oddity. 7/10.",ai,reviews
"This is easily one of the stronger Ernest outings. Jim Varney is in top form as Ernest P. Worrell, the well-meaning klutz who can’t help tripping into trouble, and his dynamic with Ron James as the long-suffering academic Abner is a big part of why it works. The story has a little more structure than some of the earlier movies: a forgotten piece of history turns out to be far more valuable than anyone expects, and suddenly Ernest and Abner are caught between shady criminals and an determined British operative who all want the same prize.

Even with the slightly higher-stakes plot, the comedy never disappears. The best moments come from the contrast between Abner trying to stay rational while Ernest goes full chaos mode. And yes, the cannon-related action bits are absurd in the best way. If you like Ernest at all, this one’s worth a watch.",ai,reviews
"I went into this movie expecting something like a straightforward erotic drama, since the opening focuses on a woman stuck in a dead-end phone job and chasing increasingly risky thrills. Then it takes a hard turn into religious obsession. Mimi Rogers plays Sharon with this uneasy mix of sincerity and intensity, and her sudden fixation on finding “the Pearl” and leveling up spiritually becomes the engine of the plot. Before long she’s talking about the Trinity nonstop, pulling a husband and child into her new worldview, and heading off toward a desert-style end-times journey like she’s auditioning for a modern prophet.

At first I honestly wondered if I’d clicked on a zealot-themed sermon film, but the explicit scenes and the overall tone make it clear it’s aiming for something darker. The finale, especially, left me feeling like the message gets twisted into something disturbing rather than uplifting.",ai,reviews
"After their parents die in a senseless accident, five brothers and sisters are forced to grow up fast and keep their household from falling apart. The oldest tries to act like a parent, the middle kids bounce between anger and responsibility, and the youngest ones carry the quiet weight of it all. What surprised me is how honestly the show tracks grief over time—messy, repetitive, and never neatly resolved. It’s basically a highly emotional teen drama, and once you’re hooked it’s hard to stop. The ensemble is strong, and it’s fun spotting actors who later became big names. Still, binging all the seasons can feel heavy; the constant turmoil really wears you down.",ai,reviews
"Quelle aventure! This adaptation is a sweeping, larger-than-life tale, packed with betrayal, revenge, and just enough romance to keep your heart in a knot. A few of the hero’s identities stretch credibility, sure, but the lead actor carries it with such force and conviction that you stop caring and simply enjoy the ride. The European locations look gorgeous—stone corridors, sunlit coastlines, and grand interiors that make the whole thing feel lavish and real. Pacing is strong, with tension building nicely and hardly any slack scenes. The supporting cast adds texture and bite. One recommendation: watch it in the original French with subtitles. The dubbed track flattens the drama and steals the music of the language. Magnifique.",ai,reviews
"The title alone pulled me in—I had to find out whether this movie would explode into something wild or just fizzle. Right from the start, watching Christian Slater wander into this worn, almost medieval-looking town, I felt that strange mix of danger and curiosity. His character arrives with a self-destructive edge, and the place seems determined to test him at every turn. He crosses paths with a stern clergyman, a chatty barber, a shrewd innkeeper, and more than a few temptations that push the romance (and the steam) up a notch. Then Robin Tunney shows up and brings a surprisingly tender, obsessive energy, especially in the candlelit bedroom scenes. Both leads commit hard, and it pays off. It’s messy, funny in spots, and unexpectedly emotional.",ai,reviews
"Ignore the naysayers and give this film a fair shot—you might be surprised. Richard Dreyfuss doesn’t look like he’s coasting; he’s clearly enjoying himself and leaning into a lighter, funnier rhythm than his more serious roles. The script is sharp, and the jokes come from character and timing rather than loud, forced slapstick. What really sold me was the constant back-and-forth: little misunderstandings, confident bluffing, and quick one-liners that keep the pace moving. Even the physical comedy feels natural instead of thrown in. I found myself smiling through most of it. And keep an eye out for Mila Kunis popping up in a classroom bit—brief, but genuinely memorable.",ai,reviews
"Where I’m from, people don’t turn every small misunderstanding into a full-on argument, so this series sometimes felt a bit exaggerated to me. It’s like everyone is constantly on edge, ready to explode instead of just taking a breath and talking normally. That said, I’m glad I stuck with it for one big reason: the way they handled the coming out storyline felt genuine and careful, not rushed or played for shock value. I didn’t exactly regret the time I spent watching, but I also kept going mostly because the Dawson/Joey tension kept pulling me into the next episode.",ai,reviews
"I really enjoyed this series, but I’m baffled by how some sites handle the cast info. How do you spotlight a bunch of minor names and somehow bury the two leads everyone tuned in for? The whole reason my friends and I watched was for the chemistry between the main partners—one Black, one Latino—and the way they played off each other in every case. The supporting characters mattered too: the love interests, the tough female detective, and the recurring squad-room faces that made the precinct feel real. And let’s not pretend the guest appearances weren’t a draw; the show had some surprisingly big cameos that deserve credit. If you’re going to archive a series, at least get the basics right and give the standout cast their due.",ai,reviews
"I know adapting a long, layered novel into a single film isn’t easy, but this version feels like it chose the safest, most predictable route. Scenes that should hit hard just pass by, and the cast never really made me care—when someone dies, I found myself thinking, “Wait, which one was that?” The plot moves, sure, but it’s more like a summary than a story with weight. If you want the richer, more detailed experience, I’d recommend finding an older mini-series adaptation instead. If you just want a straightforward period drama to fill an evening, it’s fine. Also, the historical setting matters—modern “fixes” don’t improve it, they blur the reality.",ai,reviews
"Set among the manicured hallways of a top-tier Manhattan private school, this movie kicks off with two privileged step-siblings striking a nasty little bet: can they manipulate the new headmaster’s sheltered daughter (Reese Witherspoon) before the semester begins? If you came of age in the late ’90s, it’s hard not to feel how much this film stamped itself on that era. The cast is stacked with the “it” faces of the time, and watching them now is like opening a time capsule of glossy teen drama at its most shameless.

What I loved then—and still do—is how it wraps sharp humor around genuinely unsettling behavior. I didn’t realize for years it was based on earlier material, but that doesn’t diminish it. If anything, shifting the cruelty into adolescent hands makes it hit even harder.",ai,reviews
"Going in I expected a light comedy, but this film isn’t really interested in easy laughs. It starts off almost ordinary, then drifts into increasingly strange territory until the finale snaps everything shut with a jolt that leaves you blinking at the credits. The trio at the center is what makes it work: the soft-spoken girlfriend who seems to shrink in every scene, the intimidating wife who fills the room, and the husband caught between them like a toy being tugged back and forth. The pacing is unhurried, yet it never stalls; each quiet moment adds pressure. Some of the twists may feel risqué, but the script builds them carefully enough that they don’t come off as random. With its single setting and tight cast, it plays like a tense chamber piece you have to sink into.",ai,reviews
"From Hell is crafted with an impressive level of care, and the visuals are easily the standout. The foggy streets, gaslit interiors, and moody framing give it a rich, period-soaked atmosphere that feels more like a prestige thriller than a typical slasher. The film doesn’t always nail the mystery—its explanation of the killer can feel a bit too tidy and convenient—but the ride is still consistently engaging.

The cast is a big reason it works. The performances across the board are strong, and the movie takes time to make the victims feel like people rather than disposable shock material. The scenes with the women have a surprising amount of warmth and sadness, which makes the brutality hit harder without feeling exploitative. Johnny Depp anchors the story well and brings a haunted edge to his role, though his accent slips here and there.

Even at just under two hours, it rarely drags. If you’re into dark historical horror with style and substance, this is absolutely worth owning rather than just streaming once.",ai,reviews
"I went into *The People vs. Larry Flynt* expecting a tasteless provocation, but what I got was a sharp, surprisingly human biopic that moves fast even when it’s trapped in hearings and appeals. The film tracks Flynt’s rough beginnings and his leap from hustling in clubs to pushing out a magazine designed to poke the establishment in the eye. One scandal in particular ignites the public outrage, and the story shifts into a long fight over speech, decency, and who gets to draw the line.

Woody Harrelson is magnetic—vulgar, funny, wounded, and stubborn in a way that makes him hard to dismiss even when you disagree with everything he stands for. Edward Norton brings calm intelligence as the attorney trying to keep the case grounded. Courtney Love is the surprise: raw and believable, not a gimmick. It’s messy material, but the movie finds a clear point beneath the grime.",ai,reviews
"To me, *Thillu Mullu* ranks among Rajinikanth’s finest and easily one of Tamil cinema’s most enjoyable comedies. K. Balachander uses Rajini’s charm in a way that highlights his timing more than his usual swagger, and it works brilliantly. The real scene-stealer, though, is Thengai Srinivasan—his expressions and delivery lift every moment he’s in, making even simple situations hilarious. Sowcar Janaki also shines, proving she can handle comedy with effortless ease. Visu’s writing keeps the film lively and quotable, and M.S. Viswanathan’s songs and background score give the whole movie a cheerful drive. The surprise appearance near the end is a delightful bonus.",ai,reviews
"Virus begins with a genuinely eerie setup: a strange disturbance in orbit coincides with a Russian research vessel suffering a catastrophic systems failure. When a salvage crew, led by Jamie Lee Curtis, stumbles across the drifting ship during a brutal storm, the premise practically writes itself—maritime salvage law, a floating prize, and the sense that something went terribly wrong onboard.

For a while, the atmosphere works. The corridors feel claustrophobic, the ship’s technology is unsettling, and the first signs that the crew isn’t alone are effectively creepy. Unfortunately, once the threat fully reveals itself, the film falls into a loop. It becomes a repetitive cycle of discovering another mechanical horror, scrambling through hallways, and regrouping, without much escalation or variation.

The characters rarely spark as a team, so the tension relies mostly on the creature effects. The finale arrives quickly and lands exactly where you expect. If you’re craving stronger cyborg sci-fi, you’ll likely enjoy other classics more.",ai,reviews
"Calling this sequel a shadow of the first dino blockbuster is probably still being kind. It clearly wants to recapture that lightning-in-a-bottle sense of wonder and panic, but the plot lurches from set piece to set piece like the script was assembled during a helicopter ride. Goldblum’s Ian Malcolm is back in the spotlight, delivering his trademark sarcasm while stumbling through yet another “humans meddle, nature bites back” expedition—this time on a second island where everything is predictably out of control. There are a few genuinely tense stretches, and the bigger action moments are loud, goofy fun, but it never feels as sharp or tightly built as the original. Oddly, some of the best material feels borrowed from a different story. My favorite bit: the scrappy run-in with the small, nasty pack hunters. Overall: B-.",ai,reviews
"I can see why some people hype this film up, especially anyone who’s into guns and nonstop action, but it really didn’t work for me. I found it dull between the shootouts, and when the violence hit, it was just way too much—constant gore and bodies piling up for shock value. None of the characters grabbed me either, so I didn’t care who lived or died. The director’s style is clearly “more blood, more chaos,” and maybe that’s the appeal, but it felt lazy instead of exciting. With a tighter story and less splatter, it could’ve been decent. Honestly, I’d pass and pick something else.",ai,reviews
"I streamed this film on broadcast.com and came away with mixed feelings. There’s a genuinely interesting concept here, but the execution never fully comes together. You can tell it’s a shoestring production: the visuals look flat, lighting is uneven, and the editing feels choppy, as if key moments were cut out. The performances are fine—no one is terrible—but the script doesn’t give the cast much to work with. The story also struggles to connect its own dots; scenes happen, then the movie moves on without clear cause or payoff. The first and final minutes grab you, yet the middle drags. I’d rate it about 6/10.",ai,reviews
"I keep wishing there were a little corner of the internet for the people who are absolutely obsessed with this film, because it scratches a very specific itch. If you’re the type who rolls your eyes at the loud, wink-at-the-camera baseball comedies, but you crave something quieter and more reverent, this is the one. It’s not about big speeches or tidy lessons—it’s about mood. The crack of the bat, the dusty light, the slow pauses between innings, and that feeling of stepping into a postcard from another era. I put it on when the house is empty and the night is warm, and it feels like the screen opens into a different decade. Plenty of movies chase that elusive “baseball poetry,” but this one actually lands it. If you understand, you understand.",ai,reviews
"I liked a lot about this film, especially the acting. The cast brings real weight to every scene, and several performances feel lived-in rather than showy. For most of the runtime I was pulled along by the intersecting storylines, and I bought into the characters’ pain, confusion, and small moments of grace. The pacing is patient, but I didn’t mind because the emotional build was paying off.

Then the director makes a big stylistic pivot with an extended musical sequence. It’s clearly meant as a thematic bridge, a way to connect people who don’t share the same room, but it landed as heavy-handed for me. Watching characters suddenly “perform” yanked me out of the drama, and I started noticing the filmmaking choices instead of feeling the relationships.

After that, the movie still wraps up competently, but I never fully re-entered the spell. With a subtler approach, it might have been unforgettable.",ai,reviews
"This film definitely isn’t flawless, but it’s a lot better than I expected. I had a genuinely fun time with it, especially thanks to the jokes that land more often than they miss. The cast carries the whole thing; even when the story starts stretching credibility and you can spot a few “wait, how did that happen?” moments, the performances keep you invested. There are a couple weak spots I won’t describe because they edge into spoiler territory, but the pacing dips here and there and the plot doesn’t always connect cleanly. Still, there are several standout scenes that made the ticket feel worth it. If you’re looking for an entertaining watch rather than a perfectly tight script, this one delivers. I’d watch it again. 6/10",ai,reviews
"He isn’t a slick action hero, and he sure doesn’t glide through problems with charm or genius. The lead in “Ledger Line” is stubborn, reactive, and prone to charging into a mess before he’s figured out the rules—then scrambling to patch things up after the damage is done. He’ll admit he was wrong when he’s cornered, but pride keeps him from easy apologies, and the story doesn’t hand him neat victories. The hook here is that he’s an auditor for a government agency, not a cop, and his paper trail investigation drags him straight into a tight-knit criminal scheme. The movie plays it fairly straight, but it’s grounded, tense enough, and a solid pick if you want a no-frills crime thriller.",ai,reviews
"After enjoying “The Scarlet Dove,” I went looking for more early Finnish noir and found “Hän Varasti Elämän” (1962), directed by Arne Taarkas. It’s a grim, tightly wound crime story with a terrific lead performance from Risto Mäkelä. He plays a small-time man with a big lie: after a desperate act during a payroll run, he slips into a dead stranger’s identity and escapes with the money. What follows is the unsettling part—how quickly a new town can embrace him as a respectable figure, as if charm and cash erase everything.

The movie looks great for its era, with convincingly lived-in locations and a steady, shadowy mood. Mäkelä sells both the panic and the cold calculation. The ending is startling and bleak, and the flirtatious scenes with the maid feel surprisingly bold for the period.",ai,reviews
"I hate to be the odd one out, but I didn’t connect with this movie the way so many people seem to. For a story that’s meant to feel heartfelt and lived-in, it struck me as overly polished, like it was recreating the past from a studio backlot rather than from memory. The small-town atmosphere was there in theory, yet the details felt arranged to tug at you instead of unfolding naturally. A lot of the scenes depended on coincidences and big “moment” speeches, and that made it hard for me to believe the characters were real people rather than vehicles for a message.

I went in hoping for something with the quiet, messy truth you find in the best coming-of-age films. Instead, it leaned heavily into nostalgia and sentiment. I’m sure it will work for others, but it left me cold.",ai,reviews
"There’s a little extra snap to “The Last Deadline” that sets it apart from the usual mismatched-partners action formula. You’ve seen the cynical detective paired with someone out of their depth a hundred times, but making the second lead a reputation-obsessed true-crime podcaster adds a fun layer of media commentary. The cop character is a walking fuse box, and the actor nails that simmering impatience without turning it into parody. Meanwhile, the podcaster’s frantic enthusiasm plays perfectly against him, keeping the banter sharp. The plot stays on track, the set pieces move with real momentum, and the self-aware jokes land more often than not. 7/10",ai,reviews
"I’ve always had a soft spot for this film. It’s one of the rare horror titles I can enjoy without feeling tense the whole time, and I actually like how this version wraps things up more than the earlier one. I read the novel it came from, and it’s honestly impressive how rewatchable the movie is—I’ve put it on multiple times and it still holds my attention.

What really makes it work for me is David. He feels different from the other strange kids in a way that isn’t just “creepy,” but genuinely interesting. He comes across as someone who can sense what others are feeling, and that touch of compassion makes him stand out. The story also does a great job showing why he ends up being seen as an outsider; it’s not random, it’s tied to what happened to the person he was meant to be connected with. For me, it’s a surprisingly heartfelt movie, and I can’t think of any real complaints.",ai,reviews
"Honestly, I can’t believe this movie made it out of editing. I’m only writing this because I feel a moral obligation to warn people before they waste an evening they’ll never get back. It’s painfully dull, the jokes land with a thud, and the whole thing feels like a bad sketch stretched way past its limits. I kept waiting for it to pick up, or at least make sense, and it just… doesn’t. The plot is a mess, the pacing drags like crazy, and when it finally ends you’re left wondering why you didn’t just stare at a blank wall instead. Also, if you’re watching for Jennifer Love Hewitt, don’t bother—she’s barely there. I recommended it as a joke to a friend and now I’m paying for it. Please skip it.",ai,reviews
"Even with big names on the poster, this one really lives or dies on its writing, and the script is what makes it work. It plays like a behind-the-scenes political drama that suddenly remembers it’s also a sweet, slightly idealized romance—and that blend totally clicks for me. The lead isn’t treated as a marble statue; he’s allowed to be funny, stubborn, and awkward, while the movie still respects the weight of the job. It’s surprisingly earnest without feeling corny, with little bursts of cynicism to keep it grounded. The score and speechy moments hit the emotional beats at the right times, and by the end I was fully invested. Solid 7/10.",ai,reviews
"Packed with a cast most filmmakers would kill for without needing blockbuster money, this movie hits the ground running and never really lets up. Matt Damon carries the story with an easy confidence, and Ben Affleck brings a rough-edged charm that makes their friendship feel lived-in. The supporting players are the real fireworks, though: both Martin Landau and Edward Norton grab every scene they’re given and remind you why they’ve been celebrated for years. Then there’s John Malkovich, who turns what could’ve been a stock villain into something hypnotic and unsettling. Add Famke Janssen’s presence and you’ve got a film that’s slick, tense, and endlessly watchable.",ai,reviews
"I’ll admit, Jim Carrey used to crack me up when I was younger. I remember renting this movie nonstop around middle school and thinking every goofy face and loud joke was pure comedy gold. Watching it again now as an adult, it doesn’t hit the same way. A lot of the humor feels like it’s aimed at kids who will laugh just because it’s weird or over-the-top, and that’s not really my taste anymore.

That said, Carrey still has a ton of energy, and you can see why he became such a big deal. Even when the jokes fall flat, his timing and commitment are solid. I still enjoy a few scenes out of pure nostalgia, but overall I find myself more annoyed than entertained.

If you grew up loving it, you might still have fun. If you’re expecting clever comedy, you’ll probably be disappointed.",ai,reviews
"If you want a light, entertaining time-waster, Rush Hour delivers. The set pieces are the main attraction—Jackie Chan’s choreography is sharp and creative, and the stunts keep things moving even when the plot is basically an excuse to jump to the next brawl. Chris Tucker’s nonstop energy keeps the whole thing from feeling too stiff, which helps because the story isn’t meant to be taken as anything more than a playful setup. Neither guy would carry this kind of movie as well on his own, but together the chemistry clicks. Solid buddy-action fun. 7/10.",ai,reviews
"Rab C Nesbitt is one of those comedies that never got the credit it deserved, and I’m glad the early series finally found their way onto DVD. I picked up Series 1 after hearing people talk about it for years, then ended up tracking down the rest and now I’ve got up to Series 5. It’s a shame it took so long for a classic like this to be properly available, because it still feels sharp and relevant.  

The setup is simple: a hard-drinking Glaswegian who thinks he’s got all the answers, taking aim at politics and everyday hypocrisy. Despite what some say, you don’t need a translator to enjoy it. The later episodes aren’t quite the same after Eric Cullen passed away, but the heart of the show is still there. A proper must-watch.",ai,reviews
"A lot of folks seem to bash this film without even giving it a chance, which is a shame because it’s actually a solid watch. It’s not going to win any big awards, but for an action/sci‑fi flick it delivers more than you’d expect. Kurt Russell does a surprisingly good job with very little dialogue—most of what he’s feeling comes through in his face and body language. The opening hooked me right away and had a creepy, tense vibe. The finale isn’t perfect and feels a bit rushed, yet the story still felt fresh instead of copying other movies. The lead changes gradually in an interesting way. If you like gritty sci‑fi, it’s worth a rental.",ai,reviews
"If you approach *Clubbed to Death* as a pure slice of “cinema du look,” it’s hard not to admire how confidently it paints with shadow, neon, and cigarette haze. The imagery does a lot of heavy lifting, because the narrative is almost comically thin—more a sketch than a plot, and it strains to justify even its brisk runtime. Still, the film nails that damp basement-club energy that defined mid‑90s dance culture, and the soundtrack is the real hook: cool, propulsive, and curated with obvious affection for the scene (with big-name electronic cuts that keep the pulse alive). Performances feel intentionally detached, like everyone’s half-awake under strobe lights. Flawed, but oddly hypnotic.",ai,reviews
"Steve Brooks is a slick advertising hotshot who treats every woman in his orbit like a disposable accessory. After one too many betrayals, a few of his exes decide the world would be better off without him—and the afterlife agrees. He gets bounced back to Earth with a ridiculous “redemption” assignment: find someone who genuinely cares about him. Of course, there’s a catch. The Devil meddles and Steve returns as Amanda, forced to navigate the same city and workplace from the other side of the gender divide, while pretending to be his own relative. Meanwhile, his longtime buddy Walter starts falling for “Amanda,” which adds an extra layer of awkwardness.

The concept is bold and there are moments that land, especially when the story finally admits Steve’s real problem isn’t anatomy, it’s empathy. Still, the comedy often feels like it’s coasting on the gender-swap alone. Barkin has presence, but the material begs for sharper physical timing and stronger satirical bite. The ending, however, is surprisingly satisfying.",ai,reviews
"I caught *Life* for the first time during a random channel flip and it honestly took me off guard—in a good way. Going in, I assumed it would lean hard on loud, edgy jokes, especially with Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence front and center. Instead, it plays more like a comedy with real weight to it, and the emotional beats land better than I expected.

There’s definitely some rough language (you can tell when a TV edit is patching things up), but it never feels like the movie is relying on profanity to be funny. The humor comes more from the situations and the chemistry between the leads, and that makes the quieter moments hit even harder.

If you’re looking for something that’s entertaining without being nonstop crude, this is an easy pick for a relaxed movie night. Even if you’re not a die-hard fan of either actor, the story pulls you in. The ending left me smiling. 3.5/5",ai,reviews
"I happened to catch this film late one night while channel surfing, and I didn’t expect a quiet cavalry drama to stick with me the way it did. What hit hardest was the sense of an era ending—men who built their whole identity around horses and tradition suddenly being told the future belonged to engines and steel. The story makes you picture what that transition felt like on a personal level, not just a military one: pride mixed with uncertainty, and a nagging feeling of being left behind.

Afterward I realized I couldn’t even remember the title, which sent me down a rabbit hole trying to figure out how much of the plot had roots in real events. I looked up articles on the U.S. Army’s shift toward mechanization and skimmed a few academic papers to get the timeline straight. When I finally tracked the movie down again online, I was honestly relieved—having cast info, production notes, and summaries all in one place helped connect the dots.

If anyone knows whether the main characters were based on real officers or units, I’d love to learn more.",ai,reviews
"I went into Romeo Must Die with pretty low expectations, and it ended up being a lot more fun than I’d anticipated. The plot doesn’t break any new ground, but the cast and the action keep things moving. Aaliyah comes across effortlessly on screen, and her scenes with Jet Li have an easy, believable spark. Li is the real draw here—his speed and precision are impressive, and he brings a likable sense of humor that makes the quieter moments work too. The supporting roles help round it out, with Delroy Lindo in particular bringing extra energy and presence whenever he shows up. My main gripe is that some of the fights lean on flashy visual tricks when Li’s physical ability could have carried the impact on its own. Still, the stylized X-ray-style hits are pretty memorable. Solid entertainment: 8/10.",ai,reviews
"At first glance, Porco Rosso feels like a breezy, beautifully drawn romp through sunlit skies and Adriatic waters, the kind of film you could watch just for the planes, the banter, and the sense of old-fashioned adventure. But the longer it lingers, the more you notice the weight beneath the charm. There’s a quiet bitterness in the way it looks at heroism, and an unease about the political winds gathering off-screen. It reminds me of how some of Miyazaki’s lighter capers still carry a bruise at their center—only here the bruise isn’t hidden. I’m surprised this one doesn’t come up more often. Maybe it’s the weary, older lead, the grounded historical backdrop, or the fact that the magic is mostly emotional rather than mystical. Either way, it deserves more attention.",ai,reviews
"This is one of those movies you can throw on and immediately relax into. The three main guys play off each other really well, and the casting for their younger selves mostly works too. The story stays straightforward: Roland is hours away from walking down the aisle, panics, and ends up at an ex’s place instead of the venue. His friends Mike and Slim race over to drag him back, and along the way Mike’s voiceover fills in how their friendship started and why they’re so tight.

What I liked is that the leads feel like actual people—funny, flawed, and still easy to root for—rather than stock “groom jitters” characters. I do wish the script dug a little deeper into Roland’s doubts, because they’re hinted at more than explored. Also, one of the “younger” casting choices didn’t quite sell the age difference.

Still, it’s upbeat, the 80s music is a blast, and the jokes land without leaning on tired clichés. Solid 7/10.",ai,reviews
"I ended up really enjoying this film from start to finish. The performances feel lived-in, the casting makes sense, and the writing strikes a great balance between laugh-out-loud moments and scenes that land with genuine weight. What impressed me most is how it handles a subject that still makes some audiences uneasy without turning it into a lecture or a melodrama.

I’ve watched other movies centered on gay relationships that leaned too hard on clichés or made every conflict about society’s cruelty. This one felt more grounded. The characters aren’t reduced to labels; they’re just people trying to navigate dating, fear, loyalty, and the messiness that comes with wanting someone while also protecting yourself. Even as a straight viewer, I found a lot of the relationship anxieties familiar, and the more specific struggles were presented in a way that made them understandable rather than sensational.

Spoiler-ish note: by the end, I was fully invested in seeing two men choose each other. That’s a first for me, and it’s because the movie earned it.",ai,reviews
"Donald Duck has been a comfort character for me since I was little, so I couldn’t resist checking out *The New Spirit*. The central idea is definitely a product of its era, and some of the messaging lands a bit awkwardly today, but there’s still a lot here to admire. Visually it’s terrific: bold colours, crisp drawing, and a surprising amount of detail in the backgrounds. A few of the more militaristic sequences are genuinely intense for a short cartoon, which makes the lighter opening moments feel like a smart contrast rather than a tonal mismatch. The music is bright and memorable, and the film’s standout stretch is the dreamlike segment where everyday office tools suddenly become animated in a way that’s oddly hypnotic. Donald’s energy is spot-on—eager, then gradually less certain—and that arc sells the whole thing. Overall, a well-crafted short that’s compelling even if its viewpoint feels dated. 8/10",ai,reviews
"This movie stands out in a way that’s hard to describe until you’ve sat through it. From the first few scenes, the cinematography feels slightly off-kilter in the best possible sense, and the music isn’t just background noise—it shapes the mood and keeps you uneasy even when nothing “big” is happening. The setting and era also give it a distinct identity; it doesn’t feel like it’s borrowing the usual beats from other films in the genre.

What I enjoyed most is how the story keeps shifting just as you think you’ve figured out the rules. It feeds you enough to stay invested, but never so much that you feel comfortable. Each sequence adds some new angle or detail that changes how you read what came before, and that push-and-pull made it genuinely absorbing.

Long after it ended, I caught myself replaying certain moments and wondering what I’d missed. It’s one of those rare films that lingers because it refuses to be neatly summarized, and the direction holds all those strange elements together with confidence.",ai,reviews
"I used to look forward to this series. It had a real spark back in the day, and for a while it even felt like it found its footing again in the early 2000s. But for the last decade it’s been a slow, stubborn slide downhill, and at this point it feels like the network is keeping it alive out of habit rather than any creative reason.

The jokes rarely land anymore, and the sketches feel recycled and oddly dated, like they’re chasing trends that passed years ago. The newer performers aren’t terrible, but they don’t have the timing or chemistry that made the older seasons work, and the writing comes off lazy and predictable.

What frustrates me most is how much this run has dulled the memory of what the show once was. It should’ve ended on a high note instead of limping along season after season.",ai,reviews
"This film comes across like a promising draft rather than a fully formed story. I kept wishing it had more time to breathe, because the core idea is genuinely moving and a little offbeat. It captures those early college days with surprising honesty: arriving in a huge city, not knowing anyone, and realizing how quickly people can be cold, transactional, or simply too busy to care. I ended up rooting hard for the main character—she’s upbeat and timid at once, trying to be kind while getting quietly worn down by the new surroundings. The actress nails that fragile, endearing energy without overplaying it. There are a few moments that really stick, the kind this director is especially good at creating.",ai,reviews
"This movie turned out to be a real shot of adrenaline. It’s a tense military thriller with slick effects and a pace that rarely lets up. A cocky Navy navigator pushes his more cautious pilot into a risky flight over forbidden airspace, and once they’re hit and forced down behind enemy lines, the story becomes a brutal race against time. Back at base, their commander wants to act fast but keeps running into political roadblocks, which only cranks up the frustration. Meanwhile, a ruthless officer on the ground takes things personally and hunts the surviving crewman with frightening intensity. Strong supporting cast, solid suspense, and plenty of edge-of-your-seat moments.",ai,reviews
"Most of the screen time is still carried by the pets and their celebrity voice work, while the human characters feel like background scenery. The story leans on the familiar “separated from home and forced to navigate a big city” setup, which is comforting but also pretty predictable if you’ve seen the first film. I didn’t think this follow-up matched the charm of the earlier adventure, mainly because it lingers too long on the budding dog romance and not enough on the possibilities of the San Francisco setting. With a title like this, I expected more lively set pieces and more movement through different neighborhoods, but the pacing stalls when the animals settle in one place for stretches.

That said, the banter is still the main draw. The dog and cat get plenty of snappy one-liners, and a surprising number of jokes are aimed over kids’ heads in a fun way. I also appreciated that the movie avoids heavy-handed villains or mean-spirited threats. Overall, it’s a decent, light sequel—pleasant, but not memorable.",ai,reviews
