"Robert ""Bobby"" J. Villeneuve (born August 11, 1963 in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories) is a former member of the Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly and former retail manager. Villeneuve was first elected to the Northwest Territories Legislature in the 2003 Northwest Territories general election defeating incumbent Steven Nitah to win the Tu Nedhe electoral district. He became mired in a scandal towards the end of his first term in office. Villeneuve was disciplined by the Conflict of Interest commissioner in June 2007 after swearing a legal oath that he lived in Fort Resolution, Northwest Territories.

"Danny De Bie (born 23 January 1960) is a former Belgian professional cyclist and directeur sportif, who won the men's race at the 1989 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships. His brothers Eddy De Bie and Rudy De Bie also competed professionally. Career Born in Beersel, De Bie achieved several successes on the road but started to focus on cyclo-cross full-time after taking the silver medal at the 1987 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships. He went to Switzerland which was at that time the main place for cyclo-cross races. Two years later he achieved that. The World Cyclo-Cross Championships parcours at Pont-Château in 1989, was a course that was suited to him. De Bie was able to cycle up a tough climb of almost 100 metres where his opponents such as Adri van der Poel had to walk and as a result De Bie was able to make a gap every time he went over the climb. After winning the rainbow jersey, De Bie became one of the best cyclo crossers of the world with a win in the Superprestige classification and increased popularity for the sport in Belgium. In 1991 De Bie was suspected of possible tampering with a doping control after a Superprestige race in Zillebeke and he was not allowed to take part in the World Championships that year in Gieten. De Bie was Belgium cyclo-cross champion for three years in a row and then beaten by Paul Herijgers. De Bie in his career won 11 Superprestige races. After his career he worked as directeur sportif for the team between 2000 and 2014, and in 2015.

"Mezek () is a village in southeastern Bulgaria, part of Svilengrad municipality, Haskovo Province. It lies at the foot of the eastern Rhodope Mountains, just north of the Bulgaria–Greece border and not far west of the Bulgaria–Turkey border. Mezek is famous for the well-preserved medieval Mezek Fortress (Neoutzikon - Νεούτζικον) and its two ancient Thracian beehive tombs, the Mezek and Sheynovets tombs. The village is also well known for its own winery and the Mezzek brand of Bulgarian wine. Fortress and Tomb The Mezek Fortress, in area, is claimed to be among the best preserved Bulgarian medieval castles. It dates to the 11th century. Along with the Thracian tombs, it was studied by a team under archaeologist Bogdan Filov in 1931–1932. The castle has nine towers, five of which lie at the vulnerable south wall. The Mezek Fortress was built out of stone, with two decorative lines of bricks on the outside. It suffered some destruction around 1900, when stones from the fortress were used for the construction of Ottoman barracks in Svilengrad. The Mezek Thracian tomb dates to the 4th century BC. It is a large, elongated tomb that includes a covered passage of , two rectangular antechambers of different size and a round burial chamber with a stone sarcophagus. The number of burials of noble Thracians in the tomb was no less than four. Gold, silver, bronze, iron and glass items and pottery discovered in the tomb are today displayed in the National Archaeological Museum in Sofia. Nature There is an eco-trail Sheynovets peak starting at the center of the village. It's 7 km in length and requires around 6 hours for a return trip.

"Eulace Peacock (August 27, 1914 – December 13, 1996) was an American track and field athlete in the 1930s. Peacock was born in Dothan, Alabama and raised in the Vauxhall section of Union Township, New Jersey, where he graduated from Union High School in 1933. He set the New Jersey high school record in 1933 with a long jump of that was on the books for 44 years until Renaldo Nehemiah had a jump measured at He became a rival to Jesse Owens in many sprinting competitions. He broke the high school record in the long jump the same day it was bettered by Owens. ""I had that record for two hours."" He attended Temple University in Philadelphia where he became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Peacock won the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) outdoor pentathlon championship six times, in 1934, 1935, 1937, and from 1943 through 1945. He was a sprinting prodigy, who bested the notable prodigy of his time, Owens, on several occasions. A victory by Peacock over Owens in a July 1935 meet in Lincoln, Nebraska led The New York Times to say that ""Peacock's star still is in the ascendancy"" under the headline ""Peacock's Victories Over Owens Project Duel for Olympic Fame"" After pulling a hamstring muscle, he was unable to qualify for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany. In 1942 he served in the United States Coast Guard; in later years he opened a liquor store and a car-rental business. He stayed connected with athletics by officiating at championship events and Olympic qualifying trials. He has been honored by a number of athletic bodies, including the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.

"Agnes ""Nan"" Paterson Hardie (5 October 1885 – 27 June 1947) was a Scottish labour movement activist. Life Hardie was born in Cumnock in Ayrshire, Hardie was the daughter of Keir and Lilian Hardie. Hardie was then a prominent mining trade unionist, and he later became the first leader of the Labour Party. Keir believed that Nan would be his political heir, and spent a large amount of time discussing politics with her, and introduced her to other leading figures in the movement; notably, John Bruce Glasier, with whom she retained a long-term friendship. Nan left school at the age of fourteen but, three years later, became seriously ill, suffering from pleurisy and appendicitis; although she recovered, she suffered with poor health for the remainder of her life. She accompanied her father on many speaking trips, including one to Nova Scotia in 1912, until 1915 when he became ill; Nan and her mother looked after him until he died, later in the year. In 1924, Hardie married Emrys Hughes, a socialist journalist, and she spent much of the next decade assisting him in his journalistic and political career. In 1933, she herself was elected to Cumnock Town Council, on which she served as convenor of the Public Health Committee. In 1935, she succeeded her husband as provost, and the two together waged a long campaign for slum clearance and their replacement with council housing. This was massively successful, and by 1939, three-quarters of the town's population lived in council houses. Hardie took a particular interest in children's activities, founding a park and lido in the town, and also promoted cycling. She was appointed as a magistrate, and during World War II chaired the Cumnock War Work Party; although, like her husband, she opposed the conflict, she was keen to assist in the welfare of those serving in the force and their dependents. In 1946, Hughes became seriously ill, and Hardie tried to resign as provost. Instead, the council persuaded her to take a leave of absence, but the process of caring for him damaged her own health, and she died in June 1947.

"A clearance car is a type of railroad car in maintenance of way service. Its purpose is to check the clearances around the tracks and ensure that trains conforming to the railroad's standard loading gauge or dynamic envelope will not encounter any obstruction. Additionally, by measuring the actual clearances along a route, the railroad can determine whether outsize loads can be accommodated along that route, and the largest size feasible. Design Early clearance cars simply consisted of an outline of the system loading gauge attached to a railroad car, which would be towed along the route to ensure the clearances were still sufficient. Later clearance cars functioned by using physical feelers—rods which extended from the car in all directions which would be deflected back by obstructions. These would be connected to instrumentation which displayed the actual clearance at that point. These feelers have an advantage in that they bounce back and do not break if they do hit something. Subsequently, clearance cars using lasers for measurement have come into service. These are generally HiRail trucks – road vehicles with supplemental rail wheels. Benefits The clearance car allowed accurate and speedy measurement of the clearances for a structure. Generally they were only owned by larger railroads; other railroads sometimes leased them for short periods. Some were self-propelled, while others were locomotive-hauled.

"Pauline Vanier Park is a public park in Ottawa's Riverside Park area, located on Harkness Avenue. It is named after Pauline Vanier. The park was built in the early 1960s on what had been the Munro farm, next to neighbouring General Vanier Public School. The Riverside Park Community and Recreation Association organized fireworks displays for over twenty years until changes in safety legislation required its removal to a larger area. Sheldon Ridgeway, then an Ottawa firefighter, started the public activity. After a six-year gap, the fireworks display was moved to Mooney's Bay in 2015. Facilities The park has swings and play structures for children as well as a wading pool. The city of Ottawa operates and staffs the wading pool during the summer season. The pool is not fenced. It is filled during the day and supervised by lifeguards. In the evenings, the pool is drained prior to staff leaving. The park field house is used by the lifeguards as an office and to store supplies. The field house was one of six field houses built at the same time by the City of Ottawa in 1967. The park also has two baseball diamonds with back stops, and one t-ball diamond. In the winter, a temporary skating rink, with boards, is set up in the park. The field house is used as a change room for skaters. Volunteers from the Riverside Park Community and Recreation Association take care of the ice during the season.

"The Castillo de San José (Castle of San José) is an historic fortress and art museum in Arrecife on the Canary Island of Lanzarote. History Built between 1776 and 1779 the fort was constructed to provide a defensive stronghold in case of pirate attacks, and as a public works project to provide much needed employment during a time of famine and poverty on the island. It became commonly known as the Fortress of Hunger (Fortaleza del hambre). The famine was caused by a number of factors including periods of drought, and the earlier eruption of Timanfaya between 1730 and 1736, which devastated most of the productive agricultural areas on the island. Charles III of Spain, who was concerned for the plight of the islanders, ordered that the fortress be built. Situated on a cliff above the Port of Naos, the D shaped fort has semi-circular walls facing the sea. On the landward side, the rear wall is protected by two small turrets, with a moat crossed by a lifting drawbridge leading to the main gateway. The fortress is constructed of masonry and ashlar blocks of volcanic origin. The interior which is made up of barrel vaulted rooms was mainly used as a powder store. International Museum of Contemporary Art In the 1970s the fortress was renovated and the interior redesigned by the artist César Manrique, who was born nearby, to house a museum of modern art. The museum opened to the public in 1976 as the International Museum of Contemporary Art (, abbreviated as MIAC). The exhibits are primarily from the period between 1950 and 1980, with a focus on various abstract art forms, such as modern sculpture, kinetic art, and geometric abstraction. The works are mainly by Spanish artists including Joan Miró, Antoni Tàpies, Eusebio Sempere and the El Paso group, one section is also dedicated to the Canarian artist Pancho Lasso. The courtyard is also used as a display space for outdoor sculptures and designs. Beneath the museum, the annexe of the fort was renovated and converted into a restaurant, the two connected by a spiral staircase. With curved floor to ceiling windows, the dining room has panoramic views overlooking the harbour and docks below.

"Ashburn Alley is the open concourse behind center field at Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies. It is named after Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn, Phillies center fielder from 1948 to 1959, and was also a long time broadcaster for the Phillies from 1963 until his death in September 1997. Ashburn Alley spans from the left field gate to ""The Yard"" kids area, and features a ""street-fair"" like atmosphere before and during a game. Ashburn Alley's name sake began while Ashburn was still playing. During the Phillies playing days at old Shibe Park, Ashburn was known for dropping bunts down the third baseline, which had slightly overgrown grass that helped the ball stay fair. A bronze statue of Ashburn lies in the center of the alley. Features Ashburn Alley serves as a history lesson of baseball in Philadelphia. Granite markers on the walk-way feature every Phillies all-star since the first game in 1933. Another feature of Ashburn Alley is Memory Lane. Memory Lane is located directly behind the batter's eye, and gives an extensive look at the history of Philadelphia baseball. It features the history of the Phillies, the history of Philadelphia Athletics, and history of Negro league teams in the city. At the end of the Memory Lane section offers a great view of the stadiums' two tiered bullpen. The upper bullpen, in particular, pulls snug against the concourse. On the western end of the Alley is Bull's BBQ, named after former Phillies slugger Greg ""The Bull"" Luzinski, who also operates it. Bull's BBQ is an outdoor picnic section and serves barbecue pork sandwiches, chicken, and most notably ribs. Luzinski is at most of the games and often socializes with fans. On top of the concession buildings in the center of the Alley is the Rooftop Bleachers. This area of the stadium was influenced by the old rooftop seats at the Phillies and Athletics old home Shibe Park. It was common during the 1920s for residents who lived in the rowhouses across from the ballpark to watch the games for free on their rooftops. There are many concession stands featuring Philadelphia cuisine staples such as the cheesesteak, at both Tony Luke's and Campo's. The Alley also features the '47 Brand store, which sells classic Phillies apparel, classic pennants and banners, and other items. References Philadelphia Phillies Sports in Philadelphia"

We will continue to raise our voice, we will protest against this fascist undemocratic regime of Mr Modi,"" said Ray.

"What Remains () is a novella written by Christa Wolf. It was written in 1979 but was not published until 1990, after the Berlin Wall fell. Summary It is the story of a day in the life of a nameless East German woman whose apartment and occupational activity are openly watched by the Stasi. The story raises the subject of surveillance, particularly the feeling of paranoia, self-doubt, and the disturbances it causes in everyday life; symptoms of fear and nervousness, such as unrest, sleeplessness, weight-loss, and hair-loss. Her daily routine is shaped around this surveillance. She trusts no one and suspects everyone. No conversation can be held within her apartment without the telephone jack being pulled to prevent calls from having unwanted listeners. Telephone calls are a façade, where only code words and petty banter take place. She becomes obsessed with her observers. Who are they? Who sent them? Do they have normal lives? Are they normal people outside their jobs? As a first-person narrative, the reader is transported into the author's inner monologue and introspection. By the end of the story she is very much influenced by the guests at her manuscript reading, young adults by whom the establishment feels threatened and remove by force. The main character realizes that the youth are watching and writing everything down. There is hope and one day she will be able to speak of this time and her experiences freely. And she realizes that perhaps ""they"" are right in distrusting her. 1990 German novels Novels set during the Cold War East German novels Novels by Christa Wolf Works about the Stasi"
"Carved elephant tusk depicting Buddha life stories is an intricately carved complete single tusk now exhibited at the Decorative Arts gallery, National Museum, New Delhi, India. This tusk was donated to the Museum. This tusk, which is nearly five foot long, illustrates forty three events in the life of the Buddha and is thought to have been made by early 20th century craftsmen from the Delhi region. Description The use of the complete ivory tusks for carving was popular in 18th and 19th century India, particularly in the Delhi region apart from Burma. Similar whole tusk carvings are also found in the Ivory Coast, Congo and Benin but made from the tusks of African elephants. The art of ivory carving in India is very ancient with references found in Kalidasa's Meghadūta. The earliest ivory carving from the Indian region is comb dating to the 2nd century CE found at Taxila. Ivory carving flourished in Assam and Mysore where elephants were available and the art of ivory carving had royal patronage. Ivory was an object of trade between kingdoms and they found their way into areas where the art of carving had patronage. This ivory tusk illustrates important life events of Buddha in 43 circular roundel, first 25 referring to the story of Buddha's birth to his enlightenment followed by 18 depicting his life events from enlightenment to Mahaparinirvana. Similar scenes have been presented in sculptures and paintings many a times but this ivory tusk shows few new scenes of Buddha's life such as Siddharatha's fight for a bird, his move against animal sacrifice and realization of death. As the thickness of the tusk reduces upwards, one can see at the tip three well-known postures depicting Bhumisparsha mudra, Abhayamudra and Dharmachakrapravatan mudra besides the roundels. There is also an intricately carved floral creeper banding around the roundels enhancing its beauty. Scenes The story runs from bottom to top and is arranged clockwise.

"The Washington Road Elm Allée is a stretch of Washington Road in West Windsor, New Jersey that is lined with Princeton Elm trees. The allée runs through the West Windsor fields of Princeton University and provides, along with the bridge over Lake Carnegie, a dramatic entrance to the campus. The Delaware and Raritan Canal can be found at the northern end of the allée, just before the lake. A jogging path runs through the allée and connects to the canal towpath, the main campus of the university, and other trails through the adjacent fields. History Elm Allée The original allée was planted in the mid-1920s by Princeton Nurseries, at one time the country's largest commercial plant nursery. The Elm trees are of the Princeton variety, developed by Princeton Nurseries for its landscaping quality, and are resistant to Dutch elm disease, the only one of ten resistant cultivars to have trees that have reached maturity. Of the original 136 Elms planted in the 1920s only 76 survive. They are approximately in diameter and tall. Their branches meet over the roadway to provide a leafy canopy. The allée has many replacement trees, including 16 Norway maples planted in the 1960s, and 31 Liberty elms planted in 1995. The secondary rows of Delaware Elms were planted in 1983, and a long row of forsythia to the east is thought to date from the late 1960s. Schenck-Covenhoven Burial Ground To the east of the Elm Allée, from the road, along the jogging path, can be found the Schenck-Covenhoven Burial Ground, sometimes called the Old Conover Graveyard. It contains forty or fifty graves surrounded by a stone wall and is undoubtedly the oldest cemetery in West Windsor Township, with burials dating to at least 1751. The Schenck and Covenhoven families were Dutch farmers who purchased in what is now West Windsor from William Penn in 1737. The Conover family was among the original settlers in Penns Neck, a settlement found at the south end of the allée. The cemetery has been in disuse for more than a century, though it receives some maintenance from the university.

"Willy Haas (6 July 1891 – 4 September 1973) was a German editor, film critic, and screenwriter. He wrote for 19 films between 1922 and 1933, and was a member of the jury at the 8th Berlin International Film Festival. Biography Willy Haas was the son of a Jewish lawyer. He studied law himself, and at a young age joined a literary circle with his friends Franz Werfel, Paul Kornfeld and Johannes Urzidil. He had personal contacts with Franz Kafka and Max Brod. This circle, which met in Prague at the Café Arco, also included Ernst Polak, the husband of Milena Jesenská. From 1911 to 1912 in Prague, the press of the Johann Gottfried Herder Association published the Herder-Blätter (Literary Journal of the Herder Association), whose editors were Willy Haas and Norbert Eisler. The journal published several essays by Haas. For the last two issues (# 4 and # 5), Otto Pick was involved. The Herder-Blätter published the work of many literary authors for the first time. After World War I Haas went to Berlin, where he did editorial work and also worked as a screenwriter and film critic. Together with Ernst Rowohlt, he founded the weekly Die literarische Welt in 1925. When his apartment in Berlin was repeatedly searched in 1933, he emigrated to Prague, where he worked as a newspaper editor. The literary magazine Welt im Wort (World in the Word), founded by Haas in Prague, soon ceased publication for financial reasons. After the German occupation of Prague in 1939, he went first to Italy and from there to India, where he worked as a screenwriter for at least two Indian films by Mohan Bhavnani. He also earned a salary as a censor for the British army in India. In 1948 he returned to Germany and lived in Hamburg. There he wrote for Die Welt and Welt am Sonntag, as well as for other magazines and newspapers. Haas was married three times: from 1921-1925 with the translator Jarmila Ambrozova, from 1925 to 1936 with Hanna Waldeck (who gave birth to their son in 1925), and from 1947 with Herta Doctor.

"Heathfield Park is an English country house and walled park in the village of Old Heathfield in East Sussex. History Originally called Bayley Park, the mansion was begun by James Plummer in 1677 and continued by Raymond Blackmore in the early eighteenth century. George Augustus Eliott (created Lord Heathfield in 1787) purchased the property after gaining a substantial amount of prize money following his successful leadership during the siege of Havana in 1762. It was altered and enlarged in 1766 by architect Robert (later Sir Robert) Taylor. Elliot owned the house until his death in 1790. It was renamed Heathfield Park after him in 1791 by his successor Francis Newbery, son of the publisher John Newbery. Newbery hired Humphrey Repton to landscape the park. Newbery built the ""Gibraltar Tower"" in one corner of the park, to commemorate Lord Heathfield's successful defence of Gibraltar from 1779 to 1782. The ground floor is octagonal and the upper part round, accessed by an internal circular staircase. It is also a Grade II* listed building. From 1819 to 1890, Heathfield Park was the seat of the baronets of the Blunt family. It was later owned by art patron William Cleverley Alexander, who had it remodelled in 1895 in the Georgian Revival style by architect Sir Reginald Blomfield. Brick facing was substituted for stucco, and the south-east wing was added. Alexander, who owned Aubrey House in London, died when he fell down the basement stairs of the house in 1916. Heathfield House is a Grade II* listed building. In 1963 the estate was purchased by Gerald Moore, an oral surgeon, artist, and former child actor. Moore opened the gardens to the public and established a riding school in 1963. In 1970 he restored the Gibraltar Tower, and in the 1970s he established a wildlife park. Moore sold the estate in 1993. The estate is currently privately owned. Site of Special Scientific Interest Part of the grounds is Heathfield Park SSSI, a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, due to the habitats provided by the ghyll woodland. The lichen population is important on a county level. Heathfield Park Cricket Club Part of the grounds of Heathfield Park contains a cricket club. Founded in 1878, it hosts regular league and friendly cricket for both adults and children.

"Lillias Margaret Skene, (née Hamilton; 28 March 186725 March 1957) was an Australian women's rights activist. Early life Lillias Hamilton was born on 28 March 1867 in Smythesdale, Victoria, Australia, the third child of Scottish-born police magistrate John Prendergast Hamilton and his English-vbrn wife Agnes Margaret (née Buchanan). Hamilton attended the local Alexandra College in Hamilton. On 7 November 1888 at St Mary's Anglican Church in Caulfield, she married 33-year-old sheepmaster David Alexander Skene. Career Straddled in debt, Hamilton's husband had to seek employment in New South Wales, while she and her children remained in Hamilton. In 1900 the family moved to Manly, Sydney, where they ran a modest dairy farm. In 1906, they moved to Melbourne and her husband began selling wool. The family purchased a property in South Yarra in 1910. Unable to make the second payment on the property he was buying when the banks collapsed in the early 1890s, David was forced to work as a station-manager in New South Wales. Lillias and their children stayed at Hamilton. They rejoined him at Curraweena station, near Bourke, in 1896 before moving to Glenariff and then in 1900 to Manly, Sydney. There they invested in a small dairy and leased 25 acres (10 ha). In the face of drought and the high cost of fodder, they sold out in 1906 and moved to Melbourne, where David set up as a woolbroker and stock-and-station agent. In 1910, with money inherited from her mother, Lillias acquired a house for the family at South Yarra. Skene was the assistant-secretary of the National Council of Women of Victoria (Victorian NCW). In 1915, she became the honorary manager and storekeeper of the Melbourne-based Home Hospital situated in the Government House. In 1909, she was appointed as the honorary secretary of the Women's Hospital Committee's board of management. Final years She retired from most of her commitments in 1949 and moved to Brighton. Skene died on 25 March 1957 in Armadale and was buried at the Brighton cemetery. Skene Street, in the Canberra suburb of Cook, is named in her honour.

"The Ghost-Seer or The Apparitionist (full title: Der Geisterseher – Aus den Papieren des Grafen von O**; literally, The Ghost-Seer – From the papers of the Count of O**) is a novel by Friedrich Schiller. It first appeared in several instalments from 1787 to 1789 in the journal Thalia, later appearing as a three-volume book in its own right. Content The work is narrated in the first person by the 'Graf von O**' (Count of O**). It describes the story of a German prince visiting Venice at carnival time. Right at the start of the work, the Count stresses that this story might sound incredible, but that he had witnessed it with his own eyes. Furthermore, he talks of his disinterest in deceiving the public as ""at the time these pages will tread into the world, I will not be and will neither win nor lose by the account given."" Structurally and stylistically it is not a single story, but tells of a Jesuit secret society trying to convert a Protestant German prince to Catholicism and bring him to the throne back home in order to bolster its own power base. Writing of the Prince's fate, Schiller shows him as the key to the conflict between passion and morality, passion and duty. The work's passages on religious and historical philosophy show Schiller's Enlightenment ideals, with his critique of religion and society to the fore, though a deeper exploration of Immanuel Kant was to follow later. Due to the novel's slow formation and the author's antipathy to it, it was not planned from start to finish and its style and structure is not uniform throughout, ranging from rhetorical prose, to theatrical prose, to dialogues reminiscent of Don Carlos, to the popular elements of Gothic fiction. Legacy Although the book remained unfinished, its audiences were the largest for any of Schiller's work during his lifetime. The readership was attracted by its elements typical of the Gothic novel, such as necromancy, spiritualism and conspiracies. It is thought that Johann Georg Schröpfer may have provided the inspiration for the novel. The first English translation appeared in 1800 under the title ""The Armenian"". In 1922, The Ghost-Seer was completed by horror novelist Hanns Heinz Ewers. This version was not well received by literary critics.

"Smack was a Brazilian post-punk band from São Paulo, formed in 1983 and characterized by its raw and experimental instrumentation heavily influenced by Gang of Four, Talking Heads, Os Mutantes and The Jam, among others. The band ended in 1986, but reunited in 2005. It ceased activities definitely in 2015 after vocalist Sérgio Pamplona's death. History Smack was founded in São Paulo in 1983, after a meeting between Sandra Coutinho (who was also a founding member of Cabine C and the all-female band Mercenárias), Sérgio ""Pamps"" Pamplona (a former member of Itamar Assumpção's band Isca de Polícia and one-time collaborator for short-lived rock band Kleiderman), Edgard Scandurra (of Ira!) and Thomas Pappon (who was also playing with Voluntários da Pátria at the time, and would later join Fellini). The band's debut album, Ao Vivo no Mosh, was released in 1985 via famous independent label Baratos Afins; the band recorded it live in the Estúdios Mosh (albeit with no audience), hence the album's name. Pamps originally intended to record a proper live album, but budget constraints did not allow him to do so. In order to focus more on his then-new band Ira!, Edgard Scandurra left Smack in 1986. Now a trio, the band recorded their second and last full-length album, Noite e Dia, in the same year. It was also released by Baratos Afins. Some time after the release of Noite e Dia, Smack disbanded, with Thomas quoting the reason as being ""Pamps' lack of interest on continuing the band"", as well as lack of promotion and some personal problems. 19 years later, Smack reunited, albeit without Thomas Pappon (since he moved to Europe in 1990), and performed in some venues around Brazil, with Pitchu Ferraz replacing him as drummer. Two of their songs, ""Fora Daqui"" and ""Mediocridade Afinal"", would be also included in the compilation The Sexual Life of the Savages, released by Soul Jazz Records. In 2008, they released the extended play 3, via carioca independent label Midsummer Madness. It was their first release in 22 years. The band ended again on November 5, 2015, after Pamps' death due to cirrhosis. He was 62 years old.

"The 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification UEFA Group H was one of the nine UEFA groups for 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification. The group consisted of six teams: Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Estonia, Cyprus, and Gibraltar. The draw for the first round (group stage) was held as part of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Preliminary Draw on 25 July 2015, starting 18:00 MSK (UTC+3), at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, Russia. Gibraltar was added to the group after the draw, after becoming FIFA members together with Kosovo in May 2016, and UEFA decided not to put Kosovo in same group as Bosnia and Herzegovina for security reasons. The group winners, Belgium, qualified directly for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The group runners-up, Greece, advanced to the play-offs as one of the best 8 runners-up, where they lost to Croatia and thus failed to qualify for the first time since 2006. Russia was initially partnered with the five-team Group H, which enabled the 2018 World Cup hosts to play centralised friendlies against these countries on their ""spare"" match dates. These friendlies would not have counted in the qualifying group standings. However, after the group was later expanded to include Gibraltar, these friendly matches were cancelled.

"Channel stuffing is a business practice in which a company, or a sales force within a company, inflates its sales figures by forcing more products through a distribution channel than the channel is capable of selling. Also known as trade loading, this can be the result of a company attempting to inflate its sales figures. Alternatively, it can be a consequence of a poorly-managed sales force attempting to meet short-term objectives and quotas in a way that is detrimental to a company in the long term. Channel stuffing has a number of long-term consequences for a company. Firstly, distributors will often return any unsold goods to the company, incurring a carrying cost and also developing a backlog of product inventory. Wildly fluctuating demand, combined with the excess inventory, leads to costly overtime and factory shutdowns. Even mild channel stuffing can spiral out of control as the sales department works to make up for prior overselling. Discounts used to drive trade loading can greatly affect profits, and even help establish gray market channels, because salespeople no longer adequately qualify their prospects. Occasionally, distribution channels such as large retailers have been known to identify the practice of channel stuffing by their suppliers, and use the phenomenon to their advantage. That is done by holding back on orders until the end of a supplier's quota period. The supplier's sales force then panic, and sell a large amount of the product under more favorable terms than they would under ordinary circumstances. At the beginning of the next period, no new orders are placed, and, barring any action, the cycle is then repeated. That affects customers, creating gluts and shortages as buyers turn to competing products. Corporations have been known to engage in channel stuffing and hide the activity from their investors. In the United States, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has in some cases litigated against such corporations, and private class-action suits have been filed. Channel stuffing might also be part of a broader pattern of financial impropriety. References Ethically disputed business practices Marketing techniques"
"Norton is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster (part of South Yorkshire, England), on the border with North Yorkshire. The civil parish also includes the villages of Campsall and Sutton, and has a population of 4,381, increasing to 4,625 at the 2011 Census. The northern boundary of the parish is marked by the River Went, while the Great North Road forms the western boundary. History Little is known about Norton until it was recorded in the Domesday Survey of 1086 when it probably had a population of 100 who were solely concerned with agriculture. During the medieval period that followed, Robin Hood was associated with Barnsdale Forest to the west whilst the nearby village of Campsall grew in importance, gaining a chartered market and Norman church. However, Norton gets few mentions in any surviving records from this time. At a later date, Norton Priory was developed on the banks of the River Went but this never grew to be particularly significant and was subsequently demolished following the dissolution of the monasteries in 1588. In 1745, Mary Ramsden of Norton died and left 50 shillings to the poor of Norton and ‘several estates’ to the master and fellows of Catherine Hall, Cambridge. Thus a Cambridge College became the Lord of the Manor of Norton and a handsome manor house was built in the village. In the 1800s the Forrester's Arms and the School Boy Inn were both established to serve the local population which would still be devoted to agriculture. Following the industrial revolution and the expansion of the railways, a station was opened in Norton in 1855 on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway’s Knottingley Branch. At the start of the 20th century there were rumours of the development of collieries at nearby Kirk Smeaton and Askern. As Norton was located between the two, a number of rows of red brick terraces were erected speculatively to house the anticipated influx of miners. Subsequently, Askern Colliery was opened in 1910 and a new red brick pub, the Royal Hotel, was built in Norton to serve the colliers of the village. Throughout the 20th century small areas of housing have been built throughout the village and many of the original stone cottages with their long gardens have been demolished, and infilled with housing. The Manor House was pulled down in the 1970s and other older buildings have suffered the same fate since then, e.g. Hope Farm was demolished in 2002 to be replaced a small development of private housing. Village today In the 21st century Norton serves as a commuter village for people working in the nearby towns such as Doncaster and Pontefract. It retains two pubs, a Working Mens Club and one village shop, but the only structure left of historic importance is the Grade II listed village water pump.

"Ngewo ( in Mende) is the supreme creator god of the people of Mende from Sierra Leone. Representation Ngewo is a combined deity from the male god Ngewo and the female goddess Leve, who predated Ngewo as the supreme creator god honored by the Mende people. These two gods are now worshipped together under Ngewo, with Leve considered as his consort. Ngewo is a sky god, responsible for creating the universe, and is in charge of determining earth’s natural phenomena. He is popularly depicted as a distant deity, who does not concern himself with the day-to-day goings of his worshippers. However, in certain myths, Ngewo tends to punish those who forget to pray to him as well as those who do not pay tribute to him. He communicates with the Mende people through the help of their ancestors’ spirits, dyinyinga, who also demand certain food offerings. Legends Creation of the first human Ngewo originally lived alone on earth in a cave. One day, he wanted company, so he started creating animals, in a female-male pair. Eventually, he created the first man and the first woman. Ngewo gave his creations freedom to ask him of anything, which backfired after a while. He was overwhelmed with their requests and retreated to the heavens, where he had lived since then. Origin of death Ngewo gave two messages to be received by the Mende people and told two animals, the toad and the dog, to send these messages to earth. The dog was entrusted with telling humans that they will not die, while the toad would bring a message foretelling their death instead. Unfortunately, the toad arrived first, since the dog was distracted. Thus, death became humanity’s fate.

"The Tomb of Eve, also known as Eve's Grave and Eve's Tomb, is an archeological site located in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (). It is considered by some Muslims to be the burial place of Eve. Prince Faisal, Viceroy of Hejaz, destroyed it in 1928. In 1975, the site was also sealed with concrete by religious authorities, who disapprove of pilgrims praying at tombs. Richard Francis Burton mentions seeing it in his translation of the Book of a Thousand Nights and a Night. According to folk belief, Eve is considered the grandmother of humanity, which influenced the name Jeddah which means grandmother in Arabic. Mentions Angelo Pesce mentions the site in his book on Jeddah and the earliest documented reference to the tomb: British Acting Consul S. R. Jordan, writing in early 1926, describes the tomb as follows: Dimensions Émile-Félix Gautier estimates the length of the tomb to about 130 m. The publicist Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah mentions about the dimensions: Aun Ar-Rafiq (Amir in Hijaz 1882–1905) tried to demolish the tomb, but that caused a public outcry.

"The Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother are a Catholic congregation of Franciscan religious sisters founded in Rome, Italy, in 1883, who serve worldwide, particularly in the field of healthcare. Foundations The congregation was founded at the initiative of Father Francis Mary of the Cross Jordan, founder of what was to become the Society of the Divine Savior, commonly known as the Salvatorians, as the female community of the Society. Jordan invited a young woman, Amalia Streitel (1844-1911), then a Carmelite nun in Germany, who had already been a Franciscan teaching Sister, to move to Rome to lead this effort. She left Germany for Italy, where she received the religious habit of the new Society and the religious name of Mother Frances of the Cross on 16 February 1883. She arrived to find that the housing Jordan had procured for her was an apartment lacking furniture and cooking utensils. As she was joined by other women, the Sisters took in orphans of the city, caring for them in their own apartment. Differences in vision arose between the two and in 1885, the Sisters separated from the Salvatorians. The 36 women who formed the community then went under the authority of the Diocese of Rome and were given the name by which they are now known. The congregation took the Rule of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis at that time, combining a life of service with that of contemplation. To support themselves, the Sisters provided home nursing care and worked in the sacristy of the Church of Santa Maria della Pietà in Camposanto dei Teutonici, the German national church of Rome. In 1890 Streitel arrived in the United States at the request of the Bishop of Wichita in Kansas, that the congregation take over a hospital there which was faltering. From there they expanded to Wisconsin, where they established a number of hospitals. A health resort was later opened in Denville, New Jersey, and a mission was opened in Oklahoma. Final approval of the congregation was received on 6 March 1911 by Pope Pius X, the same day that Streitel died in Castel Sant'Elia, Italy. Current status Today the Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother serve in Italy, Austria, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Germany, the United States, Grenada, St. Lucia, Tanzania and Trinidad and Tobago.

Social career Thachuparambil started his career in 1928 as the first Chaplain of Chelakkara, a backward forest area in Thrissur. There, he worked among the poor and he built St. Mary's Forane Church, a school for girls (Little Flower Girls High School), a destitute home for children which was later renamed Fr. Antony Balabhavan, a convent for nuns, Little Flower Convent and a health clinic which later grew to become Jeevodaya Mission Hospital. Canonization Thachuparambil is said to be credited with several miracles which are being considered and verified by Roman Catholic Church. His contributions for the overall development of Chelakkara, reportedly irrespective of the caste, creed or colour, were considered by the Roman Catholic Church when deciding upon initiation of his canonization process. Paul Pulikkan was appointed the postulator and as the first step towards canonization, Antony Thachuparambil was declared Servant of God by the Roman Catholic Church on 9 December 2009. In December 2020, the diocese court completed the formalities and prepared an 8090-page document detailing the priest's life and works, to be submitted to the Holy See. In the media Shalom Television aired a documentary on the life of Thachuparambil as an episode under their series, Saints Town in 2015.

"Aerodyne Technologies was a French aircraft manufacturer based in Étrembières and previously based in Talloires. The company specialized in the design and manufacture of paragliders and reserve parachutes. The company seems to have been founded before 2002 and gone out of business in 2008. The company was owned by Aerodyne International Group, which was headed by Dominique Marcu and seems to also no longer exist. Aerodyne Technologies was headed by Michel Le Blanc, who was formerly employed by paraglider manufacturers ITV Parapentes and Flying Planet. While headquartered in France, Aerodyne Technologies had its gliders constructed in a newly built factory in Mauritius. The company constructed a full line of gliders, from the beginner Aerodyne Yogi to the high-performance Shaman and the two-place Totem Bi for flight training. In 2003 the company's Jumbe glider was tested by South African reviewer Jaco Wolmarans in Annecy, France, against seven other competitor's gliders. He became very impressed with the stability and performance of the design in thermal flying and also with the company itself. He wrote, ""I was so impressed by the company, after chatting to them about their range, workmanship and the like, that I offered to represent them in SA. They agreed."" In early 2008, just before it went out of business, the company had certified its Joy model in four sizes as EN B. The Aerodyne Free had been released as a beginner's aerobatic model and the Feel was undergoing testing for certification in the EN C category, at that time forecast for April 2008. Eight different models of Aerodyne paragliders were flown by 45 pilots in 93 Paragliding World Cup competition races, between September 2002 and August 2011.

(This location would later be occupied by Burkle's The Grill at Leon Springs. The location closed in May of 2021 due to an unexpected fire that broke out at the location, and it's unclear if it will reopen.) Brinker International, Inc. bought the franchise rights to the company on November 22, 1989.

The packages are manufactured by General Mills Restaurant Favorites line. Nutrition In 2007, Men's Health rated Romano's Macaroni Grill one of the unhealthiest restaurant chains, giving it an 'F' on its ""Restaurant Report Card."" According to the report, an average meal from the chain contains over 1,000 calories. Three years later, however, the magazine rated Macaroni Grill as the healthiest Italian chain, noting that a number of entrees had significantly decreased in calorie count. This was attributed to the hiring of a new CEO with a ""multiphase plan to improve the nutritional quality.""

"Red flag laws were laws in the United Kingdom and the United States enacted in the late 19th century, requiring drivers of early automobiles to take certain safety precautions, including waving a red flag in front of the vehicle as a warning. Red flag law in the United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the Locomotive Acts was a policy requiring self-propelled vehicles to be led by a pedestrian waving a red flag or carrying a lantern to warn bystanders of the vehicle's approach. In particular The Locomotive Act 1865, also known as Red Flag Act, stated: Firstly, at least three persons shall be employed to drive or conduct such locomotive, and if more than two waggons or carriages he attached thereto, an additional person shall be employed, who shall take charge of such waggons or carriages; Secondly, one of such persons, while any locomotive is in motion, shall precede such locomotive on foot by not less than sixty yards, and shall carry a red flag constantly displayed, and shall warn the riders and drivers of horses of the approach of such locomotives, and shall signal the driver thereof when it shall be necessary to stop, and shall assist horses, and carriages drawn by horses, passing the same, The Red Flag Law was repealed in 1896, by which time the internal combustion engine was well into its infancy. Red flag law in the United States In the United States, the state of Vermont passed a similar Red Flag Law in 1894, only to repeal it two years later. This law stated that ""he owner or person in charge of a carriage, vehicle or engine propelled by steam, except road rollers"" must have a ""person of mature age  at least one-eight of a mile in advance of"" the vehicle, to warn those with livestock of its impending arrival. If at night, it also required the aforementioned person to carry a red light. The law did not apply to rail vehicles. References Bibliography Bailey, T., and Kennedy, D. The American Pageant.

"""The Novocaine Mutiny"" is an episode from the TV series M*A*S*H, the twentieth episode of its fourth season. It was aired on January 27, 1976, was written by Burt Prelutsky and directed by Harry Morgan. As Prelutsky had written a number of episodes of Dragnet, of which Morgan had been a main cast member, the episode could be said to be a reunion, of sorts, between the two men. Synopsis October 1952 Frank Burns has filed charges of mutiny against Hawkeye Pierce for an incident that happened during a busy surgical shift in the operating room. A preliminary hearing is convened to determine whether Hawkeye should face a court-martial, which could lead to his execution if he is found guilty. B. J. Hunnicutt is called as the first witness and begins to recount the events that led to the alleged mutiny. As soon as Colonel Potter departed for Tokyo for a week, Frank assumed temporary command and immediately began to implement his gung-ho vision for the camp, including a ban on gambling. When he learned that Staff Sergeant Zale had lost $300, he instituted a camp-wide search for the money, ignoring repeated insistences that Zale had lost it in a poker game. Radar is called as the next witness and testifies to Frank's intrusive search methods, ending at Radar's own bunk in the camp office. Frank never found the money because Radar had hidden it in his teddy bear. The presiding officer, Lt. Colonel Carmichael, now calls Frank to describe the mutiny itself. Frank embellishes his account to cast himself in a heroic light - performing multiple difficult surgeries, bolstering everyone's spirits, and even taking over for an exhausted Father Mulcahy to administer last rites for a patient. He claims that an overworked Hawkeye drugged him into unconsciousness and took command of the unit. Hawkeye disputes the entire story, stating that Frank had been sending patients into the OR at risk of death during surgery, instead of doing the proper pre-op workup on them. Frank accused Hawkeye and B.J. of nitpicking and complained that the surgical staff would have no chance of keeping up with the influx of wounded. When Hawkeye half-jokingly threatened Frank with physical violence, Frank backed away and was hit in the face and knocked out by an opening door. Hawkeye sent Mulcahy to work in pre-op and had Corporal Klinger drag Frank out of the OR. Carmichael decides that the evidence does not warrant a court-martial and dismisses the proceedings, expressing his derisive opinion that Frank might have been made a pastry chef if he had not been drafted as a doctor. Afterward, back at camp, Hawkeye and B. J. start a new poker game and Potter joins in, ignoring Frank's un-rescinded order against gambling.

"Boneland is a 2012 novel by Alan Garner, a sequel to The Weirdstone of Brisingamen and The Moon of Gomrath. The boy Colin from the earlier novels is now an adult, still living near the top of Alderley Edge but now a professor working at the nearby Jodrell Bank Observatory. His solitary home is a kit-built hut (""A Bergli"") in a quarry. He has a form of amnesia which means he remembers nothing from before the age of 13, including his twin sister and his childhood adventures. He visits a psychotherapist and the gradual uncovering of his past forms the main story. Interleaved with Colin's tale is another story set in the same part of England but at a distant time. A lone Stone-Age cave dweller leaves ""Ludcruck"" (the chasm of Ludchurch) in search of companionship. Garner says that the focus of his research for the book was ""the universal myth of the sleeping hero"". He has written his own experience of psychotherapy into the novel. ""Go to the pain,"" he was told by his therapist, ""go to where it hurts the most, and say whatever it tells you"". An important item towards the end of the book is a Lower Palaeolithic hand axe. Garner keeps such an axe in his study, although his is from the Acheulean culture while the one in the book is from the even older Abbevillian culture.

"Jones-Brown-Smith (also released as Rockin' in Rhythm) is an album by pianist Hank Jones, bassist Ray Brown and drummer Jimmie Smith recorded in 1976 for the Concord Jazz label. Reception Allmusic awarded the album 3 stars, stating: ""An unusual aspect to the music is that on half of the eight standards Jones switches to electric piano; although he does not display as strong a musical personality on that instrument, he plays quite well."" The Penguin Guide to Jazz praised the renditions of ""Bags' Groove"" and ""Spring Is Here"", but criticized the selection of other material, and preferred other Jones albums from the same period.

"WENU (1410 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a soft oldies format simulcasting WROW out of Albany. Licensed to South Glens Falls, New York, United States, the station serves the Glens Falls area. Established in 1988 as WSTL, the station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting. History First usage of frequency in Glens Falls 1410 AM went on the air as WSET in 1959, programming a middle of the road format; for a time, the station studios were located in the Queensbury Hotel in Glens Falls. In 1965, WSET changed its call letters to WBZA; the new call letters arose from the station owner's respect for WBZ in Boston. WSET and WBZA broadcast at 1410 AM with a ""daytime only"" license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). At sunset each day, the station would leave the air until the next day at 6am. In 1971, the format was flipped to Top 40. During the later 1970s, WBZA evolved to more of an adult contemporary format, and it eventually changed frequencies to 1230, in late 1982; that station is now WMML, a sister station to WENU. Current station From 1982 to 1988, the 1410 frequency previously occupied by WBZA was off the air, until returning as country music station WSTL in 1988. The station took on the WBZA call letters in early January 1998, and changed again in September 2000 to the current WENU. For a time being, WENU was a simulcast of the FM station, now WNYQ, with an Adult Standards format. When the FM changed to AC, WENU remained with Adult Standards. More recently, WENU has flipped to a Classic Country format. On January 30, 2012, WENU, along with sister station WMML, signed off the air, as the antenna in Queensbury, New York was torn down to allow a new antenna to be put up in place. WENU returned to the air with a new nickname, ""The U"" on March 15, 2012 and a greater focus on community news coverage. WENU's new signal allows people in northern Warren County and southern Saratoga County to hear the station. WENU's Classic Country format came to an end on February 22, 2013 while CBS Sports Radio came on February 23, 2013. On January 3, 2019, WENU dropped its CBS Sports Radio format and began simulcasting WROW, its sister station in Albany which carries a soft oldies format.

"Euseby Cleaver (8 September 1745 – 10 December 1819) was the Church of Ireland Bishop of Ferns and Leighlin (1789–1809) in Ireland and subsequently Archbishop of Dublin (1809-1819). Life He was of Buckinghamshire origin, the younger son of the Reverend William Cleaver, who ran a school at Twyford, and his wife Martha Lettice Lushden.

His exercise of the Archbishopric of Dublin was cut short for reasons of alleged insanity. He appears to have favoured the use of the Irish language. Family He married Catherine Wynne of Hazelwood, County Sligo, by whom he had several children, including William, Frances and Caroline; Caroline married Admiral James William King, and was the mother of the prominent evangelist Catherine Pennefather.

"Araucaria rulei (Rule araucaria, graceful pine) is a species of conifer in the family Araucariaceae. It is endemic to New Caledonia, where it is an endangered species. Its populations are fragmented and are generally made up of scattered individuals. It is restricted to serpentine soils, often with high nickel levels, and its natural range is almost completely restricted to areas rich in nickel. Nickel mining in New Caledonia has consequently been a major cause of its decline. Araucaria rulei grows to around 30 meters in height, with long slender branches arranged symmetrically around the trunk, which extend horizontally and then turn upwards and branch out at the end, giving the tree an appearance sometimes compared to a chandelier. Male and female cones are produced on the same tree but on different branches, with branches at the top of the tree tending to produce female cones, while branches lower down make male cones. The cones stay on the tree for 2–3 years while the seeds ripen, which are around 3 cm long when mature. It is a slow-growing plant with slow regeneration capabilities, though in its natural environment it is tolerant of both very dry conditions and high winds which many other species of araucaria will not tolerate. The species was named for an Australian nurseryman John Rule, and is sometimes grown as an ornamental tree in Australia, with its large smooth leaves and the symmetrical dome shaped growth habit of mature trees considered attractive.

"The Parliamentary Special Committee on Kashmir is predominantly composed of senior MNAs and Senators of Pakistan. Its fundamental function is to raise the critical issue of Kashmir at national and international level.

Opening Former Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, the oldest member of the house, assumed chairmanship of the CA on January 20, 2014 and administered the oath of office to 565 lawmakers at the first meeting of the assembly on January 21, 2014. Leaders of the NC, CPN-UML and UCPN (Maoist) pledged to draft a new constitution within a year. More than 80% of the members were new faces. Power-sharing discussions On January 26, 2014, President Ram Baran Yadav called for the election of a Prime Minister and the formation of a consensus government within a week as per article 38(1) of the constitution which provided for the formation of government through political understanding. The Nepali Congress obtained the support of the CPN-UML for a NC-led consensus government and the two parties also agreed to hold local body elections within six months and adopt a new constitution within a year. An all-party meeting followed at which the CPN-UML, UCPN (Maoist) and MPRF-Loktantrik expressed support for a government under Sushil Koirala. The RPP-N boycotted the meeting. Further discussions were held between the NC, CPN-UML and UCPN (Maoist) at which the Maoists expressed support for the idea of a NC-led government but did not agree to join the government and decided to stay in opposition. On February 2, 2014, the NC abandoned its pursuit of a consensus government under article 38(1) of the constitution after the UCPN (Maoist) and RPP-N, the third and fourth largest parties, decided not to join the government. The party then initiated talks with the CPN-UML to form a majority government under article 38(2) of the constitution.
