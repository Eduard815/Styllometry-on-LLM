"A new World Bank assessment says the Palestinian economy remains far below its productive capacity, warning that a brief improvement in employment last year has given way to renewed job losses amid continuing restrictions on movement. The report estimates overall unemployment at about 25%, more than double the level recorded before the outbreak of the uprising against Israeli occupation several years ago, with younger workers facing the most severe pressures. Joblessness among people in their late teens and early twenties is placed at roughly 37%, compared with about 14% prior to the conflict, the Bank said. During a period of reduced violence and fewer disruptions in 2003, employers added around 104,000 positions and output expanded by an estimated 6%. That rebound, however, proved fragile: in the first six months of the current year the economy shed more than 22,000 jobs, eroding earlier gains.

The report links the downturn to a rise in closures affecting crossings and travel between Palestinian towns, measures imposed by Israel that limit the movement of workers and goods and raise costs for trade and production. “The frequency and scope of closures strongly influence economic activity across the West Bank,” the Bank’s representative for the West Bank and Gaza said, arguing that unpredictable access has discouraged investment and disrupted commerce.

Nearly half of Palestinians—around 47%—are living in poverty, the report adds, leaving households highly exposed to further shocks. It notes that international assistance averaging about $950 million annually has helped soften the impact, including support for temporary employment programmes. The Bank urged the Palestinian Authority to reinvigorate institutional reforms and keep public finances under control to improve confidence among investors. The findings were released as senior US officials visited the West Bank to underline support for orderly preparations ahead of elections expected in January."
"Grammy-winning rapper and entrepreneur Kendrick Lamar is set to move into a major executive role after being named head of creative strategy at hip-hop label Top Dawg Entertainment, the company announced on Thursday. Lamar, who has frequently spoken about focusing more on long-term projects beyond recording, will assume the post at the start of the new year, overseeing artist development and new signings while continuing to release music through his own imprint. The appointment follows a broader restructuring at Top Dawg, which recently finalized a deal that consolidates ownership and expands its distribution partnership with a major music group.

Top Dawg’s roster includes chart regulars such as SZA, Schoolboy Q and Jay Rock, and the label has built a reputation over the past decade for developing artists into mainstream successes without abandoning its West Coast roots. In a statement, Top Dawg founder Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith said Lamar’s promotion reflects “a commitment to keeping the company led by people who understand the culture and the craft,” adding that the label aims to “open a new chapter” with a stronger global footprint.

Lamar, whose real name is Kendrick Duckworth, said he viewed the role as a way to create opportunities for emerging performers. “This is about building systems that let artists own their voices and their futures,” he said, calling the job “a responsibility to the next generation.”

Lamar has released multiple platinum albums and has been recognized for work that blends commercial appeal with socially focused storytelling. While he has hinted at stepping back from constant touring, his team confirmed he will remain active as a recording artist even as he takes on expanded responsibilities behind the scenes."
"A former senior executive linked to ex-Yukos chief Mikhail Khodorkovsky has told a Moscow court that the accusations against him are unfounded, rejecting claims of fraud and tax violations as lacking any credible legal basis. Platon Lebedev, a longtime business partner of Mr Khodorkovsky, has been appearing alongside him since hearings began in June in a case focused on the disputed acquisition of a fertiliser company during Russia’s privatisation era. 

Speaking at the start of his defence, Mr Lebedev said the prosecution’s narrative was internally inconsistent and relied on a reading of corporate transactions that he said did not match the documents in the case. He told the court he had struggled to understand how routine commercial decisions had been reframed as criminal conduct, adding that the allegations did not meet the standards required for conviction. Mr Lebedev previously ran Menatep, the holding group that once controlled Yukos.

The two defendants, who each face the possibility of a lengthy prison term if found guilty, are expected to answer a judge’s questions in the coming days as the court continues to examine evidence and witness statements. Mr Khodorkovsky, who began giving evidence last week, has denied wrongdoing and argued that the proceedings punish entrepreneurship rather than any genuine offence.

Supporters of the men have repeatedly described the case as politically driven, claiming it reflects a broader effort by the Kremlin under President Vladimir Putin to curb the influence of wealthy businessmen who rose to prominence in the 1990s. Yukos has been hit with multi-billion-dollar back-tax claims, and its key production unit was sold at auction as part of the state’s attempt to recover the alleged debt. Efforts by the company to seek protection through US courts to challenge the sale have also failed."
"French actress Marion Cotillard has been cast as the female lead in the forthcoming film version of the best-selling thriller “The Alchemist’s Cipher,” according to several entertainment outlets. The adaptation, based on the novel by American writer Lucas Meyer, will be directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Steven Soderbergh and will co-star Matt Damon as a Harvard symbologist drawn into an international puzzle. Cotillard is expected to play Damon’s skeptical partner, a Paris-based historian whose expertise becomes central to decoding a series of clues scattered across Europe’s major museums. 

Cotillard, who most recently appeared in the drama “Winter Streets,” rose to global prominence with her performance in “La Vie en Rose” and has since balanced French productions with major English-language roles. Reports said Soderbergh favored a French performer for authenticity rather than casting a high-profile Hollywood name. In recent months, British actress Emily Blunt and French stars Léa Seydoux and Eva Green were among those speculated to be in contention for the part. 

The novel has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide and follows a conspiracy narrative linked to medieval religious lore. Producers have reportedly secured permission to shoot key scenes at the Musée d’Orsay, a location featured early in the story. The project is backed by Universal Pictures and is slated for a summer 2027 release."
"Actress Naomi Hartley has obtained interim restraining orders against two freelance photographers after telling a Sydney court she no longer feels safe leaving her waterfront home. The orders were granted on Friday at Downing Centre Local Court following claims that a small recording device was discovered near the front gate of the property earlier this week, prompting Hartley to contact police. Lawyers representing the photographers, identified in court as Liam O’Connor and Marcus Reid, rejected any suggestion their clients were responsible for placing the device and said they would contest the matter when it returns to court.

Hartley, an Australian-born actor currently in the city to shoot the drama “Harbour Lights” alongside actor Daniel Price, sought the orders after an alleged incident on the weekend in which her vehicle was followed at speed through inner-city streets. Court documents described a pursuit in which cars ran amber and red lights and briefly crossed into oncoming lanes. Defence counsel said their clients were not involved and argued that the allegations were based on assumptions rather than identification.

The application was made under an apprehended violence order framework, typically used for cases involving threats, stalking or intimidation. In a statement read outside court, Hartley’s representative said the actor understands public interest comes with her profession and does not object to routine coverage. “But there is a line between lawful news gathering and conduct that makes someone fear for their personal safety,” the statement said.

Magistrate Karen Hsu, granting the interim protections, told the court that media workers have a right to earn a living but must operate within legal boundaries. She said the alleged driving behaviour, if proven, raised serious safety concerns for the public as well as the applicant. The interim orders restrict the photographers from approaching Hartley or coming within a specified distance of her residence until the next hearing."
"French actress Marion Cotillard is set to take the main female role in the upcoming screen version of bestselling thriller The Silent Cipher, according to entertainment reports. The adaptation of author Liam Hart’s novel will be directed by David Fincher and will also star Matt Damon in the role of a Harvard-trained symbologist drawn into an international mystery. Cotillard is expected to play Damon’s sharp-witted collaborator, a Paris-based archivist whose expertise helps unravel a series of encrypted clues, several newspapers said.

Cotillard, who recently appeared in the drama The Last Winter Road, has built an international profile through a mix of French productions and English-language films. She rose to wider recognition after her breakthrough in La Vie en Rose and has since worked with a range of high-profile directors across Europe and the United States.

Industry outlets said the filmmakers opted for a French lead rather than casting a more established Hollywood name. In recent weeks, speculation had linked the part to names including Emily Blunt, Eva Green and Léa Seydoux.

Hart’s novel has sold more than 12 million copies worldwide and follows an alleged cover-up connected to medieval relics and secret societies. The story opens with a murder in a major Paris museum, and reports indicate the production has secured permission to film on location there. The project, backed by Paramount Pictures, carries a budget reported to exceed $90 million and is slated for release in early 2027."
"Director George Lucas has warned that the final instalment of his Star Wars saga could be too intense for very young viewers, saying the upcoming film will push the series into darker territory than audiences have previously seen. In an interview with the US television programme 60 Minutes, Lucas said he would hesitate to bring a child aged five or six to see Star Wars: Episode III, describing it as the most violent and emotionally heavy chapter of the franchise. He added that he expects the movie to receive a US PG-13 classification, a rating that advises parental caution for children under 13 and is broadly comparable to the UK’s 12A certificate. The earlier five Star Wars releases were given the less restrictive PG rating in the United States, while British censors have largely judged them suitable for general audiences, with only Attack of the Clones receiving a PG. The new film, due to open in Britain and America on 19 May, follows the fall of Jedi knight Anakin Skywalker and his progression into Darth Vader, culminating in a climactic confrontation set against a landscape of fire, ash and flowing lava. Lucas said the story is designed as a tragic turning point for the character, focusing on moral compromise and the cost of power."
"Telecoms gear supplier Celestel Systems has cut its previously announced profit for the 2023 financial year after completing a delayed review of its accounts. In regulatory documents filed on Monday, the Toronto-based company said net income came in at $512m, down from the $781m it had reported earlier, citing adjustments tied to revenue recognition and reserves. Despite the lower earnings figure, Celestel said full-year sales were revised up by about 3% from the preliminary total, reflecting updated contract data and improved visibility into customer returns. The company’s shares, which have fallen roughly 45% over the past 12 months, rose 1.2% in afternoon trading following the filing.

The restatement follows an internal investigation launched last year that led to the departure of chief executive Mark Reilly and the suspension of two finance executives. Celestel said securities regulators in Canada and the United States continue to review the matter, and the company is cooperating with requests for information. It also reissued results for 2021 and 2022, noting that prior statements had not fully captured certain charges related to restructuring and long-term project costs.

“With these revisions now behind us, we can focus on execution and rebuilding confidence,” newly appointed chief executive Laura Chen said. Celestel added that a group of senior leaders has agreed to return cash incentives granted for 2023, totaling $9.1m, even though the company said they were not directly responsible for the accounting changes."
"Wales hooker Mefin Davies is expected to remain at Gloucester despite fresh speculation linking him with a return to the Neath-Swansea Ospreys. Sources close to the situation say the Welsh region has sounded out the 32-year-old following his impressive display in Saturday’s Six Nations victory over England, but Davies is understood to be settled at Kingsholm and keen to extend his stay in the Premiership. The former Celtic Warriors player is currently tied to Gloucester on a short-term agreement, yet club officials are believed to be preparing discussions over a longer contract after a run of consistent performances. Davies’ move to England came after the collapse of the Warriors left several players without a regional deal, prompting him to take a part-time arrangement with Neath to maintain fitness and match sharpness. He later featured for the Ospreys with the backing of the Wales coaching staff, though he previously voiced frustration at the lack of support during the uncertain summer. Davies also considered an offer abroad before opting to keep his international prospects alive in England."
"Prime Minister James Harrington is expected to set 12 May as the date for the next general election when Parliament reconvenes after the spring recess, according to the network’s chief political correspondent. The correspondent said Mr Harrington is likely to travel to Buckingham Palace in early April to request a dissolution, clearing the way for a campaign beginning almost immediately. The prime minister has so far avoided confirming a timetable, despite growing pressure from opposition leaders and intensified activity by all major parties in recent days.

Downing Street declined to comment on the reported schedule, insisting that the decision rests solely with the prime minister. A No 10 spokesperson said only that an announcement would be made “in due course” and would not be drawn on specific dates.

If the dissolution is sought at the start of April, Westminster would face a compressed final week of business as ministers attempt to complete priority legislation before MPs are sent back to their constituencies. Government whips are understood to be focusing on securing passage of the Finance Bill implementing the Budget measures, which must be enacted before the end of the session. Officials are also seeking to finalise the Public Safety and Serious Crime Bill and a long-delayed Digital Identity proposal, both of which have faced lengthy scrutiny in the Lords.

Speaking on the morning programme, the correspondent said there was “a broad expectation across the Commons” that the election would be called as soon as MPs return. While the administration is not required to go to the country until next year under the five-year limit, recent governments have often opted to seek a fresh mandate after about four years in office."
"A prominent retirement research group has warned that Britain’s pension arrangements are failing to deliver clear and adequate support, arguing that the current framework is hard for savers to understand and leaves gaps for many people. The institute said a simplified state benefit, linked to years of lawful residence rather than National Insurance records, could make entitlements more transparent and narrow disparities between those with stable careers and those with time out of work. It suggested that people with interrupted employment—such as carers and workers on irregular contracts—are more likely to miss out under contribution-based rules. The comments follow the release of an interim review by an independent pensions panel examining long-term retirement funding. That review estimates millions of employees are building up insufficient resources for later life, raising the risk of lower living standards in old age. It said closing the shortfall would likely require a mix of greater individual saving, higher public funding and/or people working longer on average."
"Australian carrier Qantas said it delivered its strongest first-half result on record after a renewed focus on trimming expenses and improving aircraft utilisation, but cautioned that momentum is likely to ease in the months ahead. The airline reported net profit of A$462m for the six months to 31 December, up 26% from the same period a year earlier and slightly ahead of market expectations of about A$440m. Despite the upbeat headline figure, shares slipped more than 2% in early trading as management signalled softer conditions in the second half.

Executives said revenue would be weighed down by weaker leisure demand following the Indian Ocean tsunami, which disrupted travel plans across parts of Asia and diverted bookings away from affected resort destinations. Chief executive Geoff Dixon said the company had seen an immediate shift in passenger behaviour, with a notable pullback in inbound travel from Japan and a rise in short-notice cancellations. Qantas estimated the impact would shave at least A$30m from sales, though it added that demand for some domestic routes had held up.

The airline also pointed to rising jet fuel prices as a growing headwind. Chief financial officer Peter Gregg said Qantas had benefited from a stronger fuel-hedging position earlier in the year, but that protection would be less pronounced in the second half, increasing exposure to market prices.

Competitive pressures are also intensifying. Qantas continues to face aggressive discounting from low-cost rival Virgin Blue, while government discussions about granting Singapore Airlines additional rights on trans-Pacific services could put pressure on one of Qantas’s most profitable corridors. Still, the company maintained guidance for higher full-year earnings, with analysts projecting profit of roughly A$720m. Qantas said it had already banked A$245m in cost reductions and remained on track to exceed its A$500m annual savings goal, even as it reviews longer-term staffing and outsourcing options."
"Sir Richard Ellison, the Conservative MP whose low-key leadership bid against Prime Minister Harold Bennett in 1992 helped expose divisions inside the party, has died at the age of 86. His family said he passed away on Tuesday at his home in Surrey after a prolonged illness. Though Ellison never expected to win, his challenge was widely viewed as a “marker” that emboldened senior figures to consider a full contest later that year, a sequence that ultimately contributed to Bennett’s resignation and the rise of William Harcourt after a subsequent ballot. Ellison later faced a backlash at constituency level and was not reselected ahead of the 1997 general election, bringing to an end a parliamentary career spanning more than two decades. Born in October 1938, he was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge. After national service with the Grenadier Guards, he worked in the diplomatic service, focusing on European policy, before entering politics. He first won the marginal seat of Westford in 1974 by fewer than 50 votes, lost it at the next election, and returned to the Commons in 1979. Colleagues said his independence and willingness to dissent limited his prospects of ministerial office."
"Former Aston Villa manager Martin O’Neill has ruled himself out of the running to take over at Birmingham City, despite being identified as a leading candidate by the club’s board. The Northern Irishman, who previously worked across the city at Villa Park, said the role was appealing in most respects but would be difficult to accept given his recent history in the area. O’Neill was approached earlier this week by Birmingham’s chief executive following the departure of head coach Mark Hughes, who left St Andrew’s to join fellow Championship side West Bromwich Albion.  

Speaking to local radio, O’Neill noted that the job offered strong foundations, including a well-supported stadium, an established training base and a squad he believes has the potential to challenge higher up the table. However, he added that taking charge of a direct rival so soon after his last spell in the region could create unnecessary complications.  

Birmingham have been placed under interim leadership since Hughes’ exit, with first-team matters currently handled by assistant coach Gary Rowett and academy director Steve Spooner. The caretaker pairing oversaw a four-match unbeaten run before Saturday’s 2-1 loss to promotion contenders Leeds United, leaving the club 13th in the standings. O’Neill has been out of management since stepping down last spring, having previously held posts at Sunderland, Celtic and Leicester City."
"UK borrowing costs are expected to stay unchanged at 4.75% after the Bank of England’s latest policy meeting, as officials weigh easing momentum against persistent inflation risks. The Monetary Policy Committee has raised rates five times over the past 12 months, but has paused since September as recent data suggest the economy is losing some pace. Output growth moderated in the last quarter, with factory activity weakening and surveys pointing to a dip in household sentiment. Economists also say the housing market, which had been a key driver of domestic demand, is showing clearer signs of cooling. Nationwide reported that average house prices slipped 0.4% in October, the sharpest monthly decline since early 2001, adding to evidence of softer conditions for buyers and sellers. Bank governor Mervyn King last month described the economy as moving through a “softer patch” after a strong start to 2004, a view echoed by market analysts who see little urgency for tighter policy this month. Richard Jeffrey, chief economist at Bridgewell Securities, said the recent run of weaker indicators makes another immediate rise unlikely, though he cautioned that the current lull may not last. “It would be a mistake to assume the peak is in,” he said, adding that further increases remain possible if demand firms."
"The dark comedy-drama The Last Detour emerged as the standout at this year’s Independent Spirit Awards, taking home every prize it was in contention for, including best feature. Director Lena Hart accepted trophies for both directing and original screenplay, sharing the writing honor with collaborator Miles Kwon. The film’s cast was also recognized, with lead actor Daniel Reyes winning best male performance, co-star Maren Elliott earning best supporting performance, and character actor Saul Benitez taking an ensemble-related acting prize. With multiple Academy Award nominations already secured, The Last Detour is widely viewed as a strong contender ahead of Sunday’s Oscars, which the Spirit Awards traditionally precede.

Elsewhere in the ceremony, newcomer Isla Torres won best female performance for her portrayal of a migrant worker in the border-set drama Dust Country, a film that also earned its writer-director, Priya Nair, the award for best first screenplay. Comedian-turned-filmmaker Jordan Pike collected best first feature for the semi-autobiographical indie Upstate, which he also wrote and starred in. The foreign-language prize went to the Romanian period piece The Orchard’s Silence, while the documentary award was claimed by Freight Train Nation, an observational look at the modern supply chain. Rising performer Mateo Rivas received the debut performance honor for his role in the coming-of-age road film Northbound.

The winners were selected by the membership of Film Independent, a voting body made up of industry professionals across acting, directing, writing and production. Last year’s top Spirit Awards winner later translated that momentum into an Oscar victory in the screenplay category."
"Arsenal midfielder Gilberto Silva has offered an account of the heated moments that unfolded after the Gunners’ recent defeat to Manchester United, confirming that emotions ran high in the immediate aftermath of the final whistle. Speaking to reporters, the Brazilian said the scene in the tunnel area was tense, with players and staff needing to be separated as tempers threatened to boil over. “There was a lot of shouting and pointing, and people trying to get in each other’s faces,” he said, while adding that he could not confirm suggestions that objects were thrown toward United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. “I didn’t see any food or drink being aimed at anyone,” Silva noted.

Silva sought to put the confrontation into context, arguing that post-match flare-ups are not uncommon in high-stakes fixtures. He said he had experienced more volatile occasions during derby matches in Brazil, though he acknowledged the rivalry between the clubs adds an extra edge.

However, Silva was critical of the intensity of several United challenges during the match, pointing in particular to tackles on winger José Antonio Reyes. He claimed Arsenal’s approach had been more disciplined and suggested at least one challenge warranted stronger punishment from the referee.

The Football Association said it is gathering reports on the tunnel incident and will review match officials’ submissions. Separate disciplinary action is also being considered following allegations of serious foul play, while Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger has been asked to clarify remarks made after the contest."
"Premier League officials are working to arrange a date for a hearing into claims that Chelsea improperly contacted Arsenal defender Ashley Cole. The league has indicated that both clubs will be invited to present their accounts before an independent commission, though no firm timetable has been set for when the session will take place. A league representative said discussions are continuing to identify a suitable window, noting that the process is not tied to a strict response period.

The matter centres on reports that Cole met Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho and chief executive Peter Kenyon at a London hotel earlier this month. If such talks took place without Arsenal’s permission, they could constitute a breach of the league’s regulations governing approaches to contracted players. Chelsea have not issued a detailed public statement addressing the alleged meeting, while Arsenal have formally requested that the league examine what they describe as an unauthorised attempt to lure the England international away.

Both sides have signalled they will co-operate with the inquiry, which is expected to be handled in a single sitting rather than as a prolonged investigation. Any findings could lead to sanctions if wrongdoing is established, although the league has not indicated what outcomes it is considering.

Cole’s club future remains under scrutiny as he continues discussions with Arsenal over a new contract. His current agreement is set to run until 2007, and negotiations are understood to be ongoing. Within the Arsenal dressing room, teammates have publicly encouraged him to remain, with Robert Pires highlighting the left-back’s long association with the club and his suitability to the team’s attacking style. Pires also acknowledged that, ultimately, the decision rests with the player."
"Sir Paul McCartney took the stage in Berlin on Saturday night for a one-off benefit concert aimed at supporting communities hit by last month’s earthquake in southern Turkey and northern Syria. The former Beatle played to a crowd of about 2,500 at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden, in an event organisers said was designed both to raise funds and to showcase a wider range of contemporary performances at the historic opera house. Proceeds will be directed to the humanitarian group Kinderhilfe Europa, which plans to help reopen a damaged school and provide temporary learning spaces for displaced children.

McCartney delivered a set drawing on decades of material, mixing well-known chart favourites with quieter ballads, accompanied on piano and acoustic guitar, and backed by a small ensemble. The performance ran for nearly three hours and proceeded without an intermission, with the audience repeatedly rising to applaud between songs.

Among those attending were former German president Joachim Gauck and several members of Berlin’s cultural community, as well as visiting diplomats. Speaking briefly from the stage, McCartney reflected on his long career and said the evening was intended to “turn attention into practical help” for families struggling to rebuild.

Separately, organisers said a charity single is being prepared featuring McCartney and singer Adele on a new recording of a classic pop standard, with an announcement on its release expected in the coming weeks."
"Organisers of the US Vibe Awards said the ceremony will return next year, despite a knife attack that disrupted this month’s event in Santa Monica. Vibe magazine president Kenard Gibbs called the incident “disturbing” and said cancelling the awards would undermine the publication’s long-standing efforts to spotlight hip-hop artists and industry achievements. The violence broke out moments before producer and rapper Dr Dre was set to accept a lifetime honour, when a man from the audience moved toward the stage area and struck the performer, witnesses said. Police allege that rapper Young Buck then stabbed the man during the chaos that followed, as security tried to separate those involved. Young Buck, whose legal name is David Darnell Brown, has been arrested and charged with attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon, and is scheduled to appear in court on 20 December. Brown is affiliated with 50 Cent’s G-Unit collective, which has ties to Dr Dre’s record label. The injured man, identified as Jimmy James Johnson, was taken to a Los Angeles hospital with a punctured lung and was listed in stable condition. Investigators said the confrontation escalated quickly amid a crowd of about 1,000 attendees, prompting additional security and police to intervene."
"Shares in Mizuho Financial Group and Nomura Holdings advanced on Thursday after market talk suggested the two Japanese financial heavyweights are exploring a broad tie-up that could include a merger. The business daily Asahi Shimbun reported that senior executives from both groups have recently exchanged views on deeper cooperation and have sounded out regulators about potential obstacles, citing people familiar with the matter. Both companies issued statements saying no formal decision had been made, while acknowledging ongoing discussions on joint initiatives in areas such as asset management and retail investment products.

Mizuho shares rose 2.1% to 2,435 yen in Tokyo trading, while Nomura gained 4.6% to 922 yen. A combination of the country’s second-largest banking group by assets and its biggest brokerage would create one of Japan’s largest financial conglomerates, with consolidated assets that analysts estimate would exceed $1 trillion, depending on the structure.

Mizuho President Masahiro Kihara said the industry faces “intensifying competition and structural change,” adding that partnerships could help improve profitability and broaden customer offerings. Nomura said it continues to evaluate collaborations that “enhance client value,” but stressed it is not currently in active talks to integrate the businesses.

Analysts noted that pressure from low interest rates and rising compliance costs is pushing firms toward scale, and that deregulation has made it easier to sell banking and investment services side by side."
"Singer and songwriter Jamie Carver is expected to spend the weekend in custody after failing to lodge £150,000 in surety required to secure his release on bail by the court’s deadline. Carver, 26, was granted conditional bail at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court on charges of robbery and blackmail, but his solicitor told the court the funds could not be assembled in time. The performer was arrested following an alleged incident at a London hotel on Wednesday night. A second defendant, musician Daniel Reeves, 24, from north London, appeared alongside him and faces the same allegations.

Magistrates imposed strict restrictions on Carver, including a nightly curfew from 10pm to 7am, with an exemption permitting attendance at a drug treatment programme. The court ordered that he must not leave his address unless accompanied by a private security provider, must hand over his passport, and must report to a local police station each day. Reeves was also placed under a curfew and required to surrender travel documents.

Police were called to the hotel in Islington after reports of an assault. A man in his 30s was taken to University College Hospital with facial injuries and was later discharged, officers said. Speaking outside court, a lawyer for both defendants said they “categorically deny” the accusations and will contest the case. Carver, who rose to prominence with the indie group The Southbound Lines before continuing with his own project, is due back in court next week."
"Four-time Olympic gold medallist Michael Johnson has questioned whether Britain’s leading sprinters are aiming high enough, saying domestic rivalries have too often taken precedence over global success. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, the former 200m and 400m world record holder argued that the primary goal for many athletes appears to be topping the national rankings, rather than consistently challenging the world’s best at major championships. He said sprinting is ultimately judged on international performance and suggested British runners need to bring a stronger sense of purpose when competing abroad.

Johnson’s comments prompted a swift response from ex-world champion Linford Christie, who warned against overlooking the realities of Britain’s development system. Christie said it can be simple to offer judgments from the outside and stressed that pathways, competition structures and support in the UK differ from those in the United States.

The American has previously clashed with British sprinter Darren Campbell, after questioning Campbell’s explanation that a hamstring injury contributed to his failure to make the Olympic finals in both the 100m and 200m earlier this year. Johnson has maintained that British sprinting can appear more animated by internal disputes than by the pursuit of medals on the biggest stages.

Addressing an elite coaching conference in Birmingham, he also cast doubt on the idea that increased funding alone will lead to better outcomes. While acknowledging the growing financial backing for athletics in Britain, Johnson said success depends on culture, competition and mindset as much as resources. He contrasted the situation with some American athletes who train with limited support, arguing that difficult circumstances can sharpen focus and increase appreciation when opportunities arise."
"January discounting has done little to lift Britain’s High Street after a weak festive period, according to a new industry survey. Retailers reported an early surge in shoppers chasing marked-down goods, but footfall and spending eased back as the month progressed, the British Retail Consortium said in figures compiled with consultancy partner KPMG. Like-for-like sales in January were up 0.6% on the same month a year earlier, a modest improvement for a period that is typically one of the strongest outside Christmas.

BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said households are still holding back on major purchases such as sofas and home electronics, with higher borrowing costs continuing to squeeze budgets. The group pointed to softer confidence amid uncertainty in the housing market and slower wage growth as factors weighing on discretionary spending.

Some categories performed better than others. Clothing and footwear fared more strongly than in December, while a number of department stores reported solid demand for beauty products and small gifts. By contrast, retailers selling furniture and larger household goods described trading as “subdued” despite extended sales and additional promotions.

Over the three months to January, like-for-like sales were flat, unchanged from the previous three-month period, the survey found. The BRC said retailers may face further pressure in the months ahead as consumers prioritise essentials and continue to seek value."
"Telecoms equipment maker Nokia Networks reported higher fourth-quarter earnings as major operators including Orange and Telefónica stepped up investment in 5G and fibre upgrades. Operating profit for the three months to 31 December reached €1.12bn, up from €820m a year earlier, the company said on Thursday. The shares fell in early trading after Nokia posted an operating margin of 41.9%, below the 43.0% level expected by analysts and slightly down from 42.6% in the previous quarter. Revenue rose 7% to €7.6bn, supported by stronger demand for radio access gear and service contracts tied to network modernisation projects.

Management said industry fundamentals remained favourable, citing continued growth in mobile data usage and the expansion of private wireless networks for enterprise customers. Chief executive Pekka Lundmark noted that more than one-third of global subscribers are now on 5G-capable plans, calling it a “multi-year replacement cycle” for operators. However, he cautioned that the order pattern seen late last year could ease as carriers digest earlier spending and work through inventory. Nokia said it expects seasonally softer sales in the first quarter and reiterated its full-year outlook, projecting steady profitability and disciplined cost control. For the full year, net profit climbed to €2.9bn from €2.1bn, while sales increased to €30.4bn from €28.7bn."
"Rapper Eminem has prevented Elvis Presley from securing a fourth chart-topper this year after “Like Toy Soldiers” debuted at number one on the singles chart. The track edged out Presley’s newly reissued “Are You Lonesome Tonight,” the latest release in a planned run of 18 remastered singles tied to the 70th anniversary of the singer’s birth. Entering the countdown at number three was “Almost Here,” a collaboration between former Westlife member Brian McFadden and Australian singer Delta Goodrem. “Like Toy Soldiers,” taken from Eminem’s album “Encore,” draws on a hook from Martika’s 1980s hit “Toy Soldiers” and continues the rapper’s recent run of success following “Just Lose It,” while addressing ongoing rivalries within hip-hop. Last week’s chart leader, Presley’s “It’s Now or Never,” dropped sharply, falling 13 places to number 14, though five Presley reissues remained inside the Top 40. Elsewhere, charity single “Grief Never Grows Old,” recorded by the One World Project to raise funds for tsunami relief, slipped to number eight. In the album rankings, Athlete moved into first place with “Tourist,” pushing the Chemical Brothers down to number six with “Push the Button.”"
"A record label linked to late R&B singer Aaliyah has been turned back in its effort to bring a lawsuit against the video-production contractor that arranged the aircraft used in the trip that ended in her fatal 2001 crash. An appellate court in New York ruled that the right to pursue a wrongful-death claim rests with the artist’s next of kin, not with her company, leaving the label without standing to sue. Aaliyah, 22, died along with eight others when a small plane went down shortly after takeoff in the Bahamas following the completion of a video shoot. Her relatives previously resolved their claims in a confidential agreement reached in 2003. Attorneys for the label said they were reviewing the ruling and had not decided whether to seek further review. Investigators examining the crash concluded the aircraft was carrying more weight than permitted and found evidence that the pilot had consumed drugs and alcohol. Aaliyah, who had been expanding a career that spanned music and acting, was later honored with posthumous accolades, and several of her releases achieved major chart success."
"Two of the biggest US carriers, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, said surging jet fuel costs weighed heavily on their latest quarterly performance, underscoring how volatile energy markets continue to shape the industry’s outlook. Delta posted a net loss of $412m for the final quarter of 2025, compared with a $168m loss in the same period a year earlier, while United reported quarterly profit slipping 18% to $602m from $736m. Both airlines said fuel expenses rose sharply year on year and warned that elevated prices could keep margins under pressure into early 2026.

Delta, which has been working to rebuild profitability after a series of operational disruptions, said it expects results in the first quarter to remain weak as fuel bills and slower corporate travel demand collide with seasonal softness. United, the largest US carrier by international capacity, said it still anticipates remaining profitable but cautioned that its ability to offset higher costs will depend on ticket yields and capacity discipline across the market.

Investors reacted cautiously. Delta shares edged up 0.4% in morning trading after the company’s loss came in slightly narrower than some forecasts, while United stock fell 1.2% as analysts focused on softer unit revenue trends. Delta chief executive Ed Bastian said the quarter reflected “an operating environment defined by unusually high input costs and intense competition,” adding that the carrier would continue to prioritize efficiency initiatives.

For the full year, Delta reported a net loss of $980m, an improvement from the prior year’s $1.6bn deficit, citing lower non-fuel costs and stronger premium demand. The airline also said it would defer delivery of 38 narrow-body aircraft to preserve cash and better match capacity to demand. Analysts said fare pressure remains a risk as airlines add seats in key domestic routes, keeping prices competitive even as costs rise."
"Music executive Marion “Suge” Knight was taken into custody over the weekend on suspicion of violating the conditions of his parole after authorities said they discovered marijuana during a traffic stop in Southern California. Knight was arrested Saturday in the Barstow area after officers pulled over a vehicle for an alleged moving violation, law enforcement officials said. He is expected to be held pending a hearing that will determine whether he will remain jailed or be returned to state prison while the alleged breach is reviewed.

Police reported that the stop occurred after the driver made an illegal turn. During a subsequent search, officers said they found suspected marijuana inside the car. Knight was also cited for an alleged insurance-related infraction, according to the report.

A woman riding in the vehicle, described by police as 18 years old, was also detained on suspicion of providing inaccurate identifying information and possessing a counterfeit identification card. Authorities said she was later released.

Knight, the founder of Death Row Records, has faced repeated legal problems over the years and has previously served jail time stemming from parole issues. In 2004, he completed a 10-month sentence linked to an incident in which prosecutors said he assaulted a man while still under supervision for an earlier conviction.

His name has long been associated with the tumultuous era of 1990s West Coast hip-hop. Knight was involved in a Las Vegas altercation in 1996 shortly before rapper Tupac Shakur was fatally shot in a drive-by attack; Knight was driving the vehicle Shakur rode in and was wounded. Death Row Records, which helped launch major careers including Shakur’s and Dr. Dre’s, has also drawn criticism for alleged ties to gang culture and for exacerbating rap’s regional rivalries."
"Shares in Midlands-based miner BritCoal slid on Thursday after the company reported a sharply wider annual loss, highlighting continued disruption at several of its underground operations. The firm said it posted a deficit of £48.9m for 2024, compared with a £3.4m loss a year earlier, citing difficult seam conditions, unplanned equipment downtime and stoppages linked to pay talks. In morning trading, the stock fell 9% to 121p.

Chief executive Martin Keane, appointed in September, said the group was working to stabilise output and improve reliability across its deepest pits. BritCoal outlined a programme of operational changes, including revised shift incentives, a tighter preventative maintenance schedule and new extraction techniques designed to keep production moving when water ingress and roof instability occur.

Management described 2025 as a “reset period” and said it was targeting a return to positive earnings in 2026, provided productivity initiatives take hold and disruption eases. The company added that stronger coal market prices had not materially lifted results because much of its output was committed under earlier contracts at lower rates.

BritCoal said its average production cost rose to £1.33 per gigajoule, while realised prices averaged £1.19 per gigajoule, squeezing margins. The group operates a network of 13 surface and deep mines across Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Northumberland and the West Midlands."
"South Korea’s Hyundai Motor said it will construct a second manufacturing facility in India as it seeks to capitalize on rising vehicle demand and expand its regional footprint. The automaker did not disclose the size of the investment, but said the new site will have an annual capacity of about 150,000 vehicles. Once operational, the additional plant would lift Hyundai’s total output capability in India—where it ranks as the country’s second-largest car producer—to roughly 400,000 units a year, the company said. Hyundai also outlined ambitious sales targets, projecting mid-teens growth in domestic deliveries in the near term and indicating that volumes could climb to around 400,000 vehicles by the end of the decade if market conditions remain favorable. The new factory is expected to be located near the company’s existing complex outside Chennai in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, a hub for auto and components manufacturing. Hyundai forecast that India’s overall passenger-vehicle market will continue to expand at a double-digit pace, approaching one million sales this year and moving toward 1.6 million by 2010. Industry analysts attribute the increase to expanding disposable incomes, limited public transportation options in many cities, and still-low private car ownership, which remains well below levels seen in developed economies. The company said it intends to use India not only to serve local buyers but also as an export platform for markets including Europe, Latin America and the Middle East, as part of its broader effort to climb into the top tier of global automakers."
"A cannabis-derived prescription medicine developed by British biotech company GW Pharmaceuticals is moving closer to regulatory clearance in Canada, potentially opening a new treatment option for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). The product, known as Sativex, is designed to ease neurological symptoms associated with MS, including spasticity and pain. The development comes after a turbulent period for the firm, whose share price fell sharply in recent weeks when UK health authorities signaled they were not yet satisfied with the evidence supporting the drug’s clinical benefits. Canadian regulators have now indicated the application has progressed to the next stage of review, raising expectations that a decision could be reached within months.

MS affects an estimated 50,000 Canadians and tens of thousands of people in the UK. Patient groups say some sufferers already use smoked cannabis to manage symptoms, though doing so remains legally and medically problematic. If authorized, Sativex would offer a standardized dose delivered as an oral spray, potentially providing a regulated alternative to self-medication.

Industry analysts described the Canadian process as a significant milestone, noting that formal approval would mark one of the first instances worldwide of a pharmaceutical product based directly on cannabis extracts receiving national authorization. GW Pharmaceuticals said it is preparing for a possible launch early next year, assuming no major delays during final evaluation.

The company holds a UK government licence to cultivate cannabis for research and manufacturing. Sativex contains measured amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), compounds that researchers believe work together to reduce certain MS-related symptoms; the formulation is also being studied for other conditions, including inflammatory pain. Production relies on tightly controlled cultivation in the UK, with security measures typical of high-value pharmaceutical crops.

News of the Canadian review update lifted investor sentiment, with GW Pharmaceuticals’ shares edging higher in London trading as markets weighed the prospects for the company’s first major commercial approval."
"Bath prop Matt Stevens has been drafted into England’s enlarged 30-man group for next weekend’s Six Nations trip to Dublin as head coach Steve Borthwick scrambles to cover a mounting injury list in the front row. With tighthead options stretched by Dan Cole’s calf problem and Will Stuart managing a shoulder complaint, Stevens has been placed on standby and could be in line for a first Test appearance if either player fails to prove fitness during the week.

Stevens, 29, had previously explored the possibility of representing Scotland through family links, but a review of his international status by World Rugby confirmed he is tied to England after featuring for an England age-grade side earlier in his career. The late call-up is a reward for strong Premiership form and for his performance in the recent England A fixture, where he impressed in the set-piece and played a role in two tries during a narrow win over a French selection.

England’s coaches are also weighing up alternative combinations in the scrum. Sale’s uncapped Asher Opoku-Fordjour remains an option, though he has spent much of this season on the loosehead side, and the staff are wary of changing the balance of the front row against an Irish pack renowned for pressure at the breakdown and in the tight exchanges.

There are further concerns in midfield after centre Manu Tuilagi was withdrawn late from club duty at the weekend with a hamstring issue. He is scheduled for a scan, while Ireland are monitoring the condition of utility back Jimmy O’Brien, who left Leinster’s match with an ankle knock. Despite those uncertainties, England are expected to keep faith with their established backline, with Harlequins’ Oscar Beard identified as the most likely replacement should a change be required.

The squad is due to assemble at England’s training base on Monday, with final selection decisions anticipated after midweek medical assessments."
"Japanese telecoms and internet group SoftBank reported a deeper quarterly loss as it ramped up promotion of a newly introduced low-priced mobile plan aimed at budget-conscious customers. The company said the service, unveiled in December, has drawn close to 900,000 applications, but the rollout has required substantial marketing outlays. For the three months ending in December, SoftBank posted an operating loss of 7.5bn yen ($71.5m; £38.4m), compared with a smaller deficit a year earlier. Executives indicated the core business would have been profitable without the launch-related spending and said they expect results to turn positive during 2006, though they declined to provide a specific earnings forecast. SoftBank rose to prominence during Japan’s technology boom in the 1990s before being hit by the subsequent downturn, and has since rebuilt its profile through acquisitions. Its purchase of Japan Telecom helped strengthen its broadband unit, which ended December with more than 5.1 million subscribers, keeping it among the market leaders."
"Model and entrepreneur Caprice and Holby City actor Jeremy Edwards have both exited the Celebrity Big Brother house following an unexpected double eviction on Friday night. Caprice was the latest contestant to leave in the programme’s planned fourth eviction, receiving just 5% of the public vote, and later told viewers she felt relieved to be out of the competition. Edwards was then removed in a further twist, departing in a surprise vote with 12% backing him to stay. With the final approaching, 19-year-old Blazin’ Squad singer Kenzie is now the bookmakers’ leading pick to claim the £50,000 prize for charity. Before the show, Caprice had been widely tipped to go early, with Ladbrokes listing her as a strong favourite for eviction and describing her as the standout candidate to be voted out so far this series. After Friday’s result, betting firms cut the odds on Kenzie, though they cautioned that a late shift in public support could still benefit former Happy Mondays performer Bez. Actress Brigitte Nielsen remains in the house alongside the other finalists. Earlier in the week, DJ Lisa I’Anson became the third celebrity to be voted out after a surprise eviction staged during a hide-and-seek task, saying she was pleased to leave and predicting Kenzie would win. The series champion will be confirmed on Sunday night."
"Japan’s major brewers are increasingly looking beyond traditional lager as high excise duties and cautious consumer spending reshape the market for alcoholic drinks. Companies say demand is accelerating for low-tax, beer-tasting beverages made with alternative ingredients that allow producers to price products below standard beer while keeping familiar flavour profiles. Asahi Breweries has forecast a sharp expansion this year in the category often described as “new-genre” or “beer-style” drinks, and expects earnings to strengthen as it rolls out a new product formulated with soybean-derived components instead of malt. Industry analysts note that branding is central to the strategy, with names and packaging designed to resemble draft beer even when the contents fall outside legal beer definitions. Rival producers have already established footholds: Sapporo has built sales around a malt-free option, while Suntory has pushed blended drinks that combine low-malt beverages with distilled spirits such as shochu. The shift has been underway for years, as households sought cheaper substitutes during Japan’s prolonged economic slump, and brewers capitalised on the lower tax brackets applied to reduced-malt and non-malt formulations. Kirin is also preparing a new entry in the fast-growing segment, intensifying competition in a market where price and taxation are increasingly decisive."
"The move to factor digital music downloads into the official UK singles chart has been postponed by four weeks, after industry concerns that smaller labels could be disadvantaged under the current online retail landscape. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) had been preparing to introduce download sales into the chart from 20 March, but the start date has now been shifted to 17 April while efforts are made to improve the visibility and availability of independent releases on major download services. BPI officials said they want to ensure that the chart reflects a broader range of music, noting that the catalogue carried by leading online outlets does not always match what is stocked in traditional retail. 

BPI chairman Peter Jamieson described the planned change as a major milestone for the charts, but said it should not proceed until there is greater confidence that independent repertoire is properly represented across digital platforms. He added that the delay would allow discussions with download retailers and chart administrators to address gaps in listings and reporting.

The Official UK Charts Company (OCC), which compiles the rankings as a joint venture between the BPI and the British Association of Record Dealers, agreed to the revised timetable at a board meeting on Wednesday. Under the new schedule, downloads will count towards the singles chart for the first time in the edition published on 17 April, covering sales from the week beginning 10 April. Similar chart integration has already taken place in the United States with Billboard’s main singles ranking."
"Motley Crue guitarist Mick Mars is facing a $10 million lawsuit filed by a former partner who alleges he reneged on assurances that he would continue supporting her financially after their relationship ended. The plaintiff, Robin Mantooth, claims that throughout their time together Mars repeatedly promised to look after her if the couple separated, but she says he rejected the existence of any such arrangement when they broke up in December. In papers lodged in Los Angeles, Mantooth is seeking a division of assets, ongoing monthly payments and additional damages. She contends that the relationship began in 1990 and that she gave up her work as a documentary film-maker to live with the musician at his home in Malibu. Mantooth also alleges that since the split Mars, 53, has provided no financial assistance. The legal action comes as Motley Crue prepares for renewed activity following a five-year hiatus. Formed in the early 1980s, the band enjoyed a string of international successes, including charting singles in the UK. They are scheduled to begin a major tour later this year, with dates planned across the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia. Mars, whose birth name is Bob Allen Deal, recently underwent hip replacement surgery and has long lived with a degenerative rheumatic condition."
"Rafael Nadal kept his momentum going at the Mexican Open in Acapulco, defeating Argentina’s Guillermo Canas to move into the semi-finals. The Spanish eighth seed, fresh from winning last week’s Brazil Open for his second ATP title, came through a tight opening set before pulling away to win 7-5 6-3. Nadal will next face Argentine wild card Mariano Puerta, who again upset the form book by edging Spain’s Felix Mantilla in a tense three-set contest, 6-4 3-6 7-6, after previously eliminating top seed Carlos Moya. In the other half of the draw, Argentina’s Agustin Calleri removed fifth-seeded Czech Jiri Novak 7-5 6-1, ending Novak’s bid to add to his past success at the event. Calleri, a former champion in Acapulco, set up a last-four meeting with Spain’s Albert Montanes. Montanes advanced to his first semi-final of the season by overturning a one-set deficit against sixth-seeded Italian Filippo Volandri, winning 4-6 6-3 6-4. Organizers said the semi-finals will be played later Friday under warm evening conditions on the coastal hard courts."
"Nasdaq Stock Market Inc., the operator of the technology-heavy Nasdaq exchange, has filed paperwork with U.S. regulators outlining plans for a public share offering that would place its stock on the very market it runs. In a registration statement submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said the transaction is expected to raise about $100m, though the proceeds would go to existing shareholders rather than to Nasdaq itself. The shares being offered were acquired through earlier private placements completed in 2000 and 2001, the filing indicated. Market participants said the move could further advance Nasdaq toward a more conventional stock-market listing, even as the company has previously played down speculation about a broader flotation. Nasdaq’s shares have already been trading in a limited fashion since 2002 on the OTC Bulletin Board, a venue associated with lightly traded securities. The exchange’s identity remains closely tied to fast-growing technology and biotech businesses, and it became a defining barometer during the late-1990s internet surge before plunging when the bubble collapsed. Improved performance at large chipmakers and resilient online retailers has since helped restore investor appetite."
"Matt Lucas and David Walliams have been ranked as the leading figures in British television comedy in a new annual survey compiled by the Radio Times. The Little Britain creators moved into first place ahead of Phoenix Nights writer and performer Peter Kay, who remains second, while The Office co-creator Ricky Gervais is placed third. The magazine said its panel assessed influence across the sector by weighing recent audience impact, industry recognition and commercial performance. Several performers entered the list for the first time, including Nighty Night actor Julia Davis, who appears in the top 10, and Black Books star Tamsin Greig, who features in the top 20. Lucas and Walliams’ climb follows a year of prominent awards attention for their sketch show, alongside strong viewing figures for the latest run on BBC Three, which delivered one of the channel’s biggest audiences since launch. Their ascent was also one of several notable shifts in the top 20: presenters Ant and Dec recorded a sharp rise into the top five, and Stephen Fry advanced further up the table after a busy year across entertainment and factual programming. BBC Three controller Stuart Murphy also gained ground, reflecting the growing profile of digital channels in commissioning comedy. By contrast, last year’s top-ranked name, chat show host Graham Norton, slipped down the order after a lighter on-screen schedule. The list also acknowledges production companies behind successful series, with outfits linked to multiple returning titles represented among the top 50."
"Actor Michael Keaton has filed a lawsuit against Silver Gate Pictures, alleging he was injured during production of the action thriller Desert Line. In court papers lodged this week in Los Angeles County, Keaton says he suffered head and neck injuries after a pyrotechnic device malfunctioned during the filming of a battle scene on the 2003 movie, which the company helped finance and produce. The complaint seeks reimbursement for past and future medical treatment and alleges the incident caused ongoing physical discomfort and emotional distress.

A representative for Silver Gate Pictures declined to address the claims, citing the active legal case.

Desert Line, directed by veteran filmmaker Daniel Rourke, follows a U.S. special operations officer who defies an extraction order to escort civilians out of a conflict zone. The movie received mixed reviews at release and delivered only modest ticket sales, according to industry tracking services.

The lawsuit describes the incident as occurring during the use of small explosive charges intended to mimic impacts near an actor’s position. Keaton contends that a charge detonated closer than planned, striking him with debris and a pressure blast. The filing does not provide detailed medical records but states that he required evaluation and treatment from physicians and other healthcare providers.

Keaton is not asking for a specific dollar amount, instead requesting damages to be determined at trial. The complaint also names the production’s special-effects supervisor, alleging the defendants failed to properly inspect, place and coordinate the devices and did not ensure that qualified personnel handled the setup."
"Greek sprinter Kostas Kenteris has rejected allegations that he engineered a traffic accident to sidestep a drug screening in the final days before the Olympic Games. Kenteris and fellow athlete Katerina Thanou are expected to be informed this week whether prosecutors will pursue criminal action linked to their failure to appear for an out-of-competition test. Investigators have been examining the circumstances of the incident, including claims that the pair may have staged the crash.

Speaking in a televised interview, Kenteris said the collision was real and described being overwhelmed when he learned officials believed he had missed the control. He said he set off in haste toward the Olympic Village in an effort to resolve the situation. Kenteris also maintained that he tried to undergo testing immediately after being taken to hospital, saying he asked medical staff at the Olympics-accredited facility to contact the International Olympic Committee so that samples could be collected there and then. According to Kenteris, no anti-doping representatives arrived during his stay.

The episode became a major story in Greece as Athens prepared to host the Games, and both Kenteris and Thanou later withdrew from competition. Kenteris has repeatedly asserted he did not attempt to evade testing and on Sunday accused Greek sporting officials and his former coach, Christos Tzekos, of failing to pass on information about the scheduled control.

The 31-year-old said he would welcome formal charges if they allow the case to be examined in court and his reputation to be restored. Kenteris, who won the Olympic 200 metres title in Sydney in 2000, also said he had been slated for a prominent ceremonial role at the opening of the Athens Games and had practiced for it before the controversy erupted."
"Ticket buyers for this year’s Glastonbury Festival will receive personalised entry passes featuring a photograph and embedded electronic data, organisers have announced, in a move designed to curb ticket touting and counterfeit sales. The passes, which link the holder’s identity to a specific ticket, are expected to be issued ahead of the event in late June, with tickets due to be released in April.

Festival founder Michael Eavis said the new system is intended to ensure admissions are limited to those who purchased through authorised channels. He warned fans against buying from unofficial sellers, saying entry would be refused if the details on the pass did not match the person arriving at the gates.

Organisers said those who prefer not to carry the new pass may instead present recognised photo identification, such as a passport or driving licence, as a secondary option at check-in points. Staff will be equipped to verify details on site, with the aim of preventing ticket transfers and reducing forgeries.

More than 150,000 people are expected to attend the music and arts event on the Eavis family’s Somerset farm, and demand has continued to outstrip supply in recent years. The popularity of the festival has led to rapid sell-outs and a thriving resale market, prompting repeated efforts to tighten ticketing rules.

Emily Eavis, who helps run the festival, previously said organisers were considering stronger measures to protect genuine customers and discourage profiteering. Past attempts at personalisation, including printing purchasers’ names on tickets and requesting supporting documents at the gate, had mixed results, with some attendees arriving without the right paperwork and some resellers offering documents to match tickets.

No official line-up has been confirmed, although speculation about potential headline acts has begun circulating as the on-sale date approaches."
"The government has moved to rebut media reports suggesting a shake-up at the top of Labour’s election operation, insisting there is no plan for Chancellor Gordon Brown to sideline campaign chief Alan Milburn. Work and pensions minister Alan Johnson said speculation about an internal power struggle was misplaced, arguing that senior figures were focused on presenting a united front as the party prepares for the next general election. His comments followed claims in the Sunday Business that Mr Brown had been asked to assume greater responsibility for media handling and overall messaging, with Mr Milburn shifting to a less prominent, coordinating position. Labour sources have long indicated the chancellor would be heavily involved in the campaign, but the latest reports come amid growing unease among some backbench MPs about the party’s performance against the Conservatives. Several MPs have privately complained that Labour has too often found itself reacting to Opposition initiatives rather than setting the agenda, a view echoed by commentators pointing to recent Conservative policy launches. The renewed talk of changes also follows a series of opinion polls indicating the gap between the parties has narrowed in recent weeks. Party strategists are said to be encouraged by internal tracking suggesting an uptick in support for Labour after last week’s Budget, increasing calls for Mr Brown to take a more visible role on the campaign trail. However, the Sunday Telegraph reported that Mr Milburn is resistant to any arrangement that would diminish his authority. Mr Johnson said both men would “work together” and dismissed suggestions of rivalry. Downing Street and Labour headquarters declined to address the reports directly."
"Carlos Moya became the first player to retain the Chennai Open crown after outlasting Thailand’s Paradorn Srichaphan in a tense three-set final, winning 3-6 6-4 7-6 (7/5). Moments after lifting the trophy, the Spaniard said he would donate his £28,000 winner’s cheque to support victims of the Asian tsunami. Srichaphan, a former champion and four-time runner-up at the event, seized early control by taking the opening set, but Moya steadied his serve and broke late in the second to level the match. The deciding set swung repeatedly, with Moya trailing 5-2 before saving match points and dragging the contest into a tie-break he edged with aggressive baseline play. Tournament organisers said several players had already indicated they would contribute their earnings to relief operations, as the event proceeded in the wake of the 26 December catastrophe that has killed more than 150,000 people across the region. Srichaphan said he planned to make a separate donation for assistance in Thailand, where the death toll has exceeded 5,000. The ATP also confirmed a contribution to Unicef’s emergency fund in Tamil Nadu, with additional backing from tour sponsors."
"Organisers of this year’s Berlin International Film Festival say the event, which begins Thursday with the historical drama *Man to Man*, will highlight a renewed momentum in European filmmaking. Of the 21 titles vying for the festival’s top prizes, a majority come from European directors, with French productions forming one of the largest national contingents. Festival director Dieter Kosslick told reporters that the selection reflects growing confidence across the continent’s industry and a run of strong critical and box-office performances. While noting that major U.S. releases continue to draw audiences, he said the current line-up shows Europe has expanded both its range and ambition. Kosslick also dismissed suggestions that political tensions, including debate over the Iraq war, have cooled local interest in American cinema, arguing that programming decisions were driven by quality rather than sentiment. Around 350 films are due to be screened during the 10-day festival, and a further 300 titles will be presented at the European Film Market running in parallel for buyers and distributors. A number of high-profile actors are expected to appear, including Will Smith, Kevin Spacey and Keanu Reeves, though Kosslick said scheduling conflicts created by the earlier date of the Academy Awards have limited some attendance. He added that organisers are considering moving the festival to January next year to reduce future clashes. The Berlinale runs through 20 February."
"Foreign Secretary David Miliband is to travel to Poland later this month to attend events marking the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, officials have confirmed. The Duke of Gloucester will accompany the British delegation for National Holocaust Memorial Day ceremonies on 27 January, alongside representatives from survivor organisations and faith groups. Historians estimate that more than a million people, the vast majority of them Jews, were murdered at the camp complex during the Second World War.

The announcement follows criticism from opposition politicians after it emerged that a junior minister had initially been expected to represent the UK at the main commemoration. Conservative foreign affairs spokesman William Hague welcomed the change of plan but accused the government of acting only after pressure mounted. “It is right that Britain is properly represented at a moment of such gravity,” he said, adding that the decision should have been made earlier.

In London, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are due to lead a national service of remembrance at Westminster Hall, with senior figures from across public life invited to attend. Buckingham Palace said the Queen will also host a reception for survivors and their families at St James’s Palace.

The commemorations come as renewed attention has focused on the responsibilities of public figures after a member of the Royal Family drew condemnation for wearing an offensive costume at a private party. Jewish leaders have said the anniversary is an opportunity to confront the consequences of Nazi ideology and to reinforce education about the Holocaust, in which about six million Jews were killed."
"Top seed Novak Djokovic fought off two match points before edging past Spain’s David Ferrer in a tense Dubai Open showdown on Wednesday. The world number one needed two hours and 20 minutes to secure a 4-6 6-3 7-6 win, recovering from 4-6 down in the deciding-set tiebreak to clinch it 8-6. Djokovic struggled to find rhythm in the opening set, spraying errors from the baseline as Ferrer capitalised with sharp returns and consistent depth. The Serb steadied in the second, raising his first-serve percentage and forcing longer rallies to pull level. In a nervy final set, both players held serve under pressure before the match turned on a handful of points in the breaker, where Djokovic saved two match points with aggressive forehands and then closed out on his own opportunity. He advances to the quarter-finals to meet seventh seed Andrey Rublev, who beat Germany’s Jan-Lennard Struff 7-5 6-4. Djokovic said he was not alarmed by another long match, noting he had recently been pushed to three sets in successive outings."
"Band Aid 20’s charity re-recording has remained at the top of the singles chart for a second consecutive week, keeping it in a strong position in the run-up to the Christmas number one. The track, which brings together a range of contemporary artists including Chris Martin and Jamelia, once again fended off competition from Kylie Minogue, whose I Believe in You held steady in second place. Ice Cube’s You Can Do It slipped a spot to third, while Destiny’s Child dropped to fourth with Lose My Breath. Girls Aloud completed the top five with their Children in Need release I’ll Stand By You, continuing to attract attention through its fundraising ties as well as its chart performance.

Among the week’s movers, Robbie Williams secured the only new entry in the top 10 with Misunderstood, a song recorded for his Greatest Hits collection. Elsewhere on the albums chart, there were no fresh releases across the top 40, reflecting an industry strategy of front-loading major launches earlier in the season to maximise holiday sales.

U2’s How to Dismantle an Atom Bomb extended its reign at number one for a third week, with Williams’ Greatest Hits holding at two. Il Divo climbed to third, while Maroon 5’s Songs About Jane continued its gradual rise to seven despite having been available for nearly a year. Abba Gold also edged back into the top 40, years after its original release, underscoring the enduring seasonal appeal of familiar catalogue titles."
"US rapper Travis Scott is facing a $30m (£24m) civil lawsuit from a former freelance stylist who alleges she was drugged and sexually assaulted by the artist and members of his entourage after a late-night television taping in 2022. The complaint, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Monday, claims the woman attended an after-show gathering following a music performance recorded for a major broadcast network, where she says a drink offered to her was tampered with and she later lost consciousness. She alleges she awoke in a private room and was assaulted, and that security staff prevented her from leaving immediately. Scott has not been charged in connection with the allegations.

A spokesperson for the musician, whose real name is Jacques Webster, denied the claims, describing them as “categorically false” and saying the plaintiff was attempting to “pressure a settlement through sensational allegations.” The network named in the suit said it could not discuss pending litigation but maintained it had “strong policies and procedures” in place for guests and contractors. The lawsuit also names three unidentified associates, a production company involved in the taping, and the corporate parent of the broadcaster, alleging negligence and failure to provide a safe workplace.

The plaintiff’s attorney said the woman delayed filing suit while seeking a resolution outside court and because she feared professional retaliation. The filing requests damages for medical expenses, emotional distress, and lost income, and seeks a jury trial. Scott, a Grammy-nominated artist with multiple chart-topping releases, has previously denied misconduct allegations in unrelated matters."
"Canadian video game studio BioWare is planning to stage public auditions this weekend to recruit members of the public whose likenesses could appear in upcoming titles. The role-playing game developer, known for franchises including Mass Effect and Dragon Age, said it is looking for volunteers aged 18 to 99 to serve as facial reference for in-game characters. The company said selected participants will be paid a performer’s fee in exchange for permission to use their image in future projects. Organisers are asking interested people to attend sessions at a shopping centre in west Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, and to bring government-issued photo identification to confirm age and identity.

A spokesperson involved in the casting process said the studio builds worlds populated by large ensembles, requiring a range of faces beyond those typically seen in traditional modelling calls. The company is seeking “everyday people” as well as individuals with distinctive features, to help create more varied crowds and supporting roles across different settings, from towns and markets to military outposts and remote villages.

Those selected will undergo a 3D capture process that involves taking extensive photographic references from multiple angles so artists can generate a detailed digital head model. The studio said the resulting scans are designed to reproduce facial structure and skin detail with high fidelity, allowing developers to create characters that look believable at close range.

BioWare also said participants should understand that once the scanning is complete, the studio retains creative control over how the likeness is applied. A face may be used in different contexts across projects, potentially appearing as a protagonist in one game, a minor non-player character in another, or a villain elsewhere. The company said it would not be able to offer editorial approval over storylines, costumes, or character roles."
"Defending champions Manchester United and Premier League pace-setters Chelsea have been handed demanding trips in the FA Cup fifth round draw, with United set to visit Everton and Chelsea heading to Newcastle. Two lower-league survivors remain in contention after Brentford and Hartlepool were paired again in a replay, the winners earning an away match at Southampton. Burnley, meanwhile, were given a home fixture against local rivals Blackburn in an all-Lancashire clash. The meeting at Goodison Park is likely to attract added attention following Wayne Rooney’s high-profile switch from Everton to United, with the forward in line to face his former side for the first time since the move. Elsewhere, Nottingham Forest could be sent to West Bromwich Albion should the Baggies progress from their fourth-round replay with Tottenham. Arsenal were drawn at home and will meet either West Ham United or Sheffield United, depending on the outcome of their replay. Charlton Athletic were paired with Leicester City, while Bolton Wanderers will take on Derby County or Fulham once their tie is decided. The fifth-round matches are scheduled to be played over the weekend of 19 and 20 February."
"A record number of schools across the UK are preparing to stage a nationwide mock general election in a government-supported programme designed to spark pupils’ interest in public life. Organisers said around 600 schools have already enrolled in the Y Vote Mock Elections 2005, coordinated by the Hansard Society, with more expected to join before voting begins. Participating pupils will take on roles commonly found in election campaigns, including standing as candidates, drafting speeches, planning messages and canvassing classmates for support.

Schools Minister Stephen Twigg said encouraging political understanding among young people was vital for the long-term strength of democratic participation. He said the project was intended to help pupils learn how elections work, why they matter, and how individual involvement can shape outcomes. By running campaigns and taking part in the count, he added, students would gain first-hand experience of the responsibilities and choices that come with voting.

The programme is being delivered in partnership with the Electoral Commission and the Department for Education and Skills. Michael Raftery, the Hansard Society’s project manager, said the aim was to recreate the atmosphere of a real contest while promoting citizenship education and informed debate in schools. He said mock ballots could help students understand competing priorities and the practical challenges parties face when trying to persuade voters.

Voting in schools is expected to take place in early May, close to the date widely anticipated for the next general election. Election packs sent to invited schools include ballot papers, guidance for running polling stations and materials to help pupils compare manifesto promises and key issues."
"England prop Dan Cole has vowed to keep his focus on conditioning after a forearm fracture ended his hopes of featuring in this season’s Six Nations. The 33-year-old sustained the injury in Leicester Tigers’ 22-19 Premiership victory over Northampton Saints on Saturday, with scans later confirming a break to the ulna in his left arm. Cole is scheduled to have surgery early this week and is expected to be sidelined for six to eight weeks, putting his international availability in doubt.

Cole said he was determined to remain involved at the club while he recovers. “It’s obviously disappointing, but it doesn’t stop you doing the work you can do,” he said. “Once the operation is done, the plan is to get back in the gym quickly and keep the fitness side ticking over.”

He added that he had sought advice from team-mate James Cronin, who missed part of last season with a similar problem. “He told me the first few days are the toughest and then you can start moving forward again,” Cole said. “Hearing that helps, because you want to keep a routine and stay connected.”

Leicester head coach Michael Cheika described the timing as “cruel” after Cole had completed his first full match since December. “Dan has been building nicely and needed the minutes,” Cheika said. “He’s in excellent shape, and the frustrating part is that this comes just as he was finding rhythm. We’ll support him through the process, but it’s a significant blow.”"
"Top seed Alex de Minaur was sent tumbling out of the Brisbane International on Friday after a straight-sets loss to American hard-hitter Ben Shelton in the quarter-finals. De Minaur, touted as one of the favourites in the final tune-up events ahead of the Australian Open, was edged 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 as Shelton relied on a heavy serve and aggressive first-strike tennis to blunt the home player’s speed.

Shelton will meet Argentina’s Francisco Cerundolo in the semi-finals after the fifth seed defeated Austria’s Sebastian Ofner 6-3 3-6 6-2 in the day’s earlier match. In the other half of the draw, Belgium’s David Goffin rallied past third seed Karen Khachanov 4-6 7-6 (9-7) 6-4 and will face second seed Grigor Dimitrov, who advanced by beating fellow Bulgarian Adrian Andreev 6-2 4-6 6-1.

“I was serving well when it mattered and stayed calm in the tiebreak,” Shelton said. “Against a guy who gets so many balls back, you can’t let up.”

De Minaur downplayed the setback, saying his priority remains peaking in Melbourne. “This is part of the process,” he said. “The goal is to be ready for the Australian Open, and that’s where I want my best tennis.”"
"Baroness Betty Boothroyd has called for the House of Lords to appoint a dedicated presiding officer, arguing that members of the upper chamber should take greater responsibility for shaping its future. Speaking in a broadcast interview, the former Commons Speaker said the current constitutional arrangements left the Lords without clear leadership inside the chamber and risked undermining public confidence. She suggested that earlier changes to the Lords were introduced without sufficient agreement on the final destination, leaving peers and ministers to manage the consequences years later. “If reform is to mean anything, it needs a plan and it needs ownership,” she said.

The Labour government’s 1999 legislation removed the automatic right of most hereditary peers to sit and vote, leaving a small number in place on an interim basis while wider reform was considered. The move was presented as an initial step in a broader process, but successive administrations have struggled to settle on a lasting model for membership and powers.

Ministers indicated that further proposals could feature in the party’s next election platform, though they declined to set out details. Lord Falconer, the lord chancellor, said the balance of authority between the Commons and the Lords remained central to any overhaul, including how the two Houses resolve disagreements and scrutinise legislation. He said any commitments would be made in due course.

Under current arrangements, the lord chancellor performs the Lords’ key ceremonial and procedural functions while also holding senior roles in government and the legal system. Baroness Boothroyd said the concentration of responsibilities was no longer appropriate, and urged the appointment of a Speaker whose sole focus would be to chair proceedings, uphold standards and represent the Lords independently."
"More than 1,000 residents and visitors gathered Sunday in the Nebraska town where television icon Johnny Carson spent much of his youth, offering a hometown farewell to the former “Tonight Show” host. Carson, who fronted the late-night program for three decades, died on Jan. 23 after a long struggle with emphysema, according to family representatives. He moved to Norfolk at age eight and lived there until entering the Navy, but maintained ties for years through frequent visits and charitable giving. The memorial drew former classmates, teachers and community leaders to the Johnny Carson Theater at the local high school. Organizers said Carson had declined a large public service in Los Angeles, where he lived later, preferring that any commemoration be rooted in the community that shaped him. Speakers recalled his early stage appearances as a teenage magician and highlighted donations that helped fund school and arts projects, including a major contribution toward a performing arts facility. National leaders also issued statements praising his impact on American entertainment."
"A committee in the European Parliament has called for substantial changes to draft European Union legislation that would define how patents apply to inventions involving software, after lawmakers declined to endorse the latest version. Members of the Legal Affairs Committee said the European Commission should return with a revised proposal, arguing that the text failed to command broad political support and left key questions unresolved. The planned directive is aimed at clarifying whether and when innovations that rely on computer code to deliver a technical effect can qualify for patent protection across the EU, an area where national approaches and court decisions have varied.

The issue has divided industry and lawmakers for years. Critics, including some small technology firms and advocates of open-source development, warn that wider patentability could tilt the market toward large multinationals with extensive legal resources, making it harder for start-ups to innovate without fear of litigation. They also say ambiguous definitions could encourage a surge of broad claims over everyday programming techniques. Proponents, backed by parts of the manufacturing and software sectors, counter that clearer rules would protect genuine research and development, reduce uncertainty for investors and help European companies safeguard products from imitation.

The draft suffered political setbacks in the Council of the EU after Poland and other governments raised objections, prompting renewed debate in several national parliaments and intensifying lobbying from both sides. At the committee session, support for the text was limited, and lawmakers concluded that reopening the process would allow a more comprehensive discussion among member states before any final vote.

Observers frequently point to the United States, where software and certain online business methods can be patented, as a reference point in the debate. Opponents fear Europe could drift toward similarly expansive protections, while supporters insist the EU can craft a distinct, narrower standard."
"London’s West End will turn the spotlight on its leading productions and performers on Monday as the Evening Standard Theatre Awards return for a ceremony at the National Theatre. Among the contenders for best musical is Mel Brooks’ The Producers, led by Nathan Lane and Lee Evans, facing competition from revivals including Sweeney Todd and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. In the race for best play, judges will choose from a varied shortlist that includes Edward Albee’s The Goat, or Who is Sylvia?, Martin McDonagh’s unsettling drama The Pillowman, and Alan Bennett’s schoolroom comedy The History Boys. The best actress category features Pam Ferris, Victoria Hamilton and Kelly Reilly, with Ferris recognised for her stage performance in Notes on Falling Leaves at the Royal Court, after a career better known to many television viewers. For best actor, Richard Griffiths, who plays teacher Hector in The History Boys, is nominated alongside Douglas Hodge for Dumb Show and Stanley Townsend for Shining City. Directors in contention include Luc Bondy for Cruel and Tender, Simon McBurney for his interpretation of Measure for Measure, and Rufus Norris for Festen, which also appears in the design category. Designers shortlisted range from Ian MacNeil, Jean Kalman and sound specialist Paul Arditti to Hildegard Bechtler for Iphigenia at Aulis and Paul Brown for False Servant. The Milton Shulman Award for outstanding newcomer will go to one of four rising actors: Dominic Cooper, Romola Garai, Eddie Redmayne or Ben Whishaw. Playwrights David Eldridge, Rebecca Lenkiewicz and Owen McCafferty are also in the running for the Charles Wintour Award, which carries a £30,000 bursary. Organisers said three special 50th anniversary honours will be presented during the evening to mark the milestone."
"Britain will not reopen talks on its annual EU budget rebate at next week’s European Council meeting, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has told MPs, insisting the arrangement remains warranted despite renewed calls for reform. Appearing before the Commons foreign affairs committee, Mr Straw said the mechanism—won by Margaret Thatcher in 1984 to offset what the UK argues is an uneven balance between what it pays in and what it receives back—should not be treated as a bargaining chip in discussions on the bloc’s future finances. His remarks follow comments by incoming European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso, who has floated the idea of redistributing the rebate among member states that are net contributors to the EU budget. Mr Straw said some governments in the enlarged 25-country Union still needed to accept the UK’s case, but added that London’s position was “straightforward” and would not be altered at the summit.

The Brussels gathering, beginning on 16 December, is expected to set the tone for protracted negotiations over the EU’s 2007–2013 spending plans, with diplomats warning that an agreement may not be reached until well into 2005 and possibly later. Several states—including the UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden—are pressing for overall spending to be limited to around 1% of the Union’s combined national income, while the Commission has proposed a higher ceiling of 1.26%. Mr Straw argued that adopting the Commission’s figure would amount to a sharp expansion in EU spending that few national governments could justify domestically.

He also said he hoped leaders could agree a timetable next year to begin membership talks with Turkey, while cautioning that accession itself would remain a distant prospect."
"Software developers who distribute programs that covertly monitor activity on personal computers may soon face significant penalties under a new California measure aimed at curbing so-called spyware. The statute, set to take effect on 1 January after being signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, seeks to reduce unauthorized tracking and limit the theft of personal information by requiring clearer consent and stronger disclosure from companies that install software on users’ machines. Security specialists have warned that spyware is expected to remain a leading irritation and risk for home PC owners, in part because such programs can embed themselves deeply within operating systems and quietly transmit data back to third parties.

At its most damaging, spyware can capture sensitive details including account credentials and payment information, and it may alter browser settings or system controls to make removal difficult. Analysts say newer variants are routinely updated to evade detection, forcing consumers to rely on a mix of anti-spyware tools and frequent security patches. A common subset, often described as ad-supported software, can log browsing habits and trigger persistent pop-up advertising, disrupting normal use and potentially exposing users to further security threats through malicious links.

While lawmakers in Washington have been considering several proposals to address the problem nationwide, California’s action positions the state as an early mover on consumer computer privacy. The law prohibits the installation of software that commandeers a computer without permission and requires businesses to inform users when an application will collect data or change settings. It also allows individuals to pursue damages of up to $1,000 per incident, alongside possible enforcement by state authorities.

The legislation follows broader efforts in California to strengthen privacy protections. Recent industry surveys have suggested that spyware remains widespread on consumer PCs, with many machines carrying multiple hidden trackers. In the absence of clear legal standards, users have increasingly turned to free and commercial anti-spyware programs to detect and remove unwanted software."
"General Motors said it expects profit to fall in 2025 compared with last year, pointing to persistent price pressure in the US market and continued restructuring costs in Europe. The automaker said rising expenses tied to employee medical benefits and warranty provisions in North America, along with weaker results at its financing arm, are likely to weigh on full-year performance. Even so, the company said it remains on track to achieve its targets for 2024 when it reports results later this month, citing solid demand for several high-margin models and cost controls implemented in the second half of the year.

GM, which sells vehicles under brands including Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac in the United States and Opel and Vauxhall in Europe, said it plans to maintain its shareholder return commitments for 2025, with dividends and buybacks broadly in line with the current year. However, it forecast earnings per share next year in a range below 2024 levels, reflecting what executives described as a “highly competitive” environment and the impact of ongoing investments in electrification and software.

Chief executive Mary Barra said management is focused on improving profitability across regions and strengthening free cash flow generation, adding that the company’s long-term financial goals remain unchanged. GM said its European operations should show narrower losses in 2025 as a multi-year efficiency programme continues, including capacity adjustments and headcount reductions concentrated in Germany and the UK.

In other regions, the company reported progress during 2024, including improved margins in Asia-Pacific and a return to profitability in parts of Latin America and the Middle East, helped by new model launches and a more favourable mix of sales. GM’s finance subsidiary, which has been a significant contributor in recent years, is expected to post lower net income in 2025 due to tighter credit conditions and a shift in loan demand. The company reiterated that it is aiming to lift annual earnings materially over the next several years through cost cuts, product upgrades and growth in its services business."
"Theo van Gogh’s short film *Submission* has been removed from the programme of the International Film Festival Rotterdam after organisers cited heightened security concerns. The title had been scheduled to screen as part of a freedom-of-speech strand honouring the Dutch director, who was killed in 2004, and was one of three of his works selected for the tribute. The film, made in collaboration with Somali-born Dutch politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, sparked fierce debate for its depiction of women’s lives under Islam and was widely linked to the threats van Gogh received after it aired on Dutch television. He was shot and stabbed in Amsterdam in November of that year.

Festival officials said the decision to withdraw the film was taken after consultations with authorities and partners, and stressed that the move was based on risk assessment rather than editorial judgement. Two other van Gogh titles remain on the schedule, including the first theatrical screening of his final feature, *06/05*, which examines the killing of politician Pim Fortuyn.

The 10-day festival opens on Wednesday with French documentary-maker Raymond Depardon’s courtroom film *The 10th District Court: Moments of Trials*. Fourteen films are competing for the festival’s Top Tiger prizes, aimed at highlighting emerging directors. New programme sections introduced this year include strands focusing on future-oriented cinema and global filmmaking, with added spotlights on Russian and South-East Asian work. An Iraqi-German production, *Underexposure*, exploring daily life in Iraq after Saddam Hussein, is also among the featured titles."
"News Corp, the media group controlled by Rupert Murdoch, is weighing whether to expand into the video games business as it searches for new areas of growth beyond traditional publishing and broadcasting. The Wall Street Journal reported that chief operating officer Peter Chernin told investors the company has been reviewing “a wide range” of game developers and publishers and has held preliminary talks with advisers about possible acquisitions. One company said to have been discussed internally is Los Angeles-area publisher Activision, though no approach has been confirmed and any deal would depend on valuation and strategic fit.

Interest in the sector has been fueled by the continuing rise of console gaming, led by platforms such as Sony’s PlayStation, Microsoft’s Xbox and Nintendo’s GameCube, which have helped push game sales into mainstream entertainment. Modern titles increasingly resemble film productions, with large teams, sophisticated graphics and marketing campaigns that can rival Hollywood releases. As development costs have climbed, publishers have also benefited from higher retail prices and longer-lived franchises, making the business attractive to media companies seeking predictable revenue streams.

Chernin cautioned, however, that finding the right purchase may prove challenging. He said News Corp is trying to navigate between the biggest players—such as Electronic Arts, whose market value is far higher—and smaller studios that may depend heavily on a limited number of brands. Activision’s market capitalization has been estimated at just under $3bn, compared with more than $17bn for Electronic Arts, according to recent market data.

The industry has also been undergoing a wave of consolidation, with major publishers seeking scale to spread development risks and secure access to popular titles. Ubisoft, one of Europe’s largest game makers, has recently taken steps to preserve its independence after Electronic Arts disclosed plans to build a significant stake, prompting analysts to predict further mergers across the sector."
"India has reached a long-term energy agreement with Iran valued at about $40bn, committing to purchase several million tonnes a year of liquefied natural gas while also opening the door for Indian companies to invest in upstream projects in the Islamic Republic. Officials said the pact is intended to bolster fuel security as India’s economy expands and domestic output fails to keep pace with demand. The arrangement, announced after meetings in New Delhi that brought together major Middle Eastern producers and leading Asian importers including China, Japan and South Korea, mirrors recent supply-and-investment packages Tehran has been offering to anchor long-term buyers.

Under the outline terms disclosed by the two sides, Iran would begin delivering roughly 7.5 million tonnes of LNG annually over a 25-year period starting in 2009, with pricing and shipping details to be finalised in subsequent contracts. In parallel, a consortium led by state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corporation is expected to pursue participation alongside the National Iranian Oil Company in developing the Yadavaran and Jufeyr oilfields, according to a joint statement.

The announcement came as ONGC indicated it was also exploring acquisitions of overseas assets, including properties formerly linked to Russia’s embattled Yukos. India’s crude production has largely plateaued in recent years, leaving refiners increasingly reliant on imports. Government figures show the country now meets about 70% of its oil needs from abroad, with consumption rising sharply over decades to around 2.4 million barrels per day."
"A US public television distributor said it will alter a scene in the BBC Films drama *Dirty War* for its forthcoming broadcast, citing heightened sensitivity among American broadcasters to indecency complaints and potential regulatory repercussions. The film, which portrays a fictional terrorist incident involving radiological material in central London, includes a brief sequence showing a nude female survivor being decontaminated after exposure to chemicals. PBS programming executive Jacoba Atlas said the network considers the moment peripheral to the plot and does not want the broadcast to be derailed by disputes over content. Rather than removing the sequence entirely, PBS plans to substitute alternate footage and adjust camera framing so the decontamination is depicted without an explicit frontal view.

The decision comes as US stations face increased scrutiny over sexual content on free-to-air television. Last year, the Federal Communications Commission imposed a $550,000 fine on CBS after a fleeting onstage exposure involving singer Janet Jackson during the Super Bowl halftime show, a penalty that has prompted many broadcasters to reevaluate standards for nudity, language and graphic imagery. Atlas said airing the unedited film could expose PBS and its member stations to financial and legal risk, and might lead some local outlets to decline the programme altogether. By making limited edits, she said, PBS aims to keep the film available to a wide audience while avoiding content that could trigger formal complaints. The film has previously aired uncut in the UK, and is scheduled to be shown without edits on US cable channel HBO later this month."
"The indie comedy-drama *Riverbend* emerged as the top winner at this year’s Independent Spirit Awards, collecting five trophies from five nominations and cementing its status as a late-season awards contender. The film received the night’s top prize for best feature, while filmmaker Lena Hart was honored for best director and shared the best screenplay award with co-writer Daniel Cho. Performances in *Riverbend* were also recognized, with Marcus Peña winning best lead performance and supporting prizes going to Alana Reed and Dominic Shaw. The strong showing comes as the film heads into the Academy Awards with four nominations, adding momentum ahead of Sunday’s ceremony. Now in its 21st year, the Spirit Awards celebrate projects produced outside the major studio system and traditionally take place in the final stretch of the awards calendar. Elsewhere, best actress went to Isabel Rojas for her portrayal of a young paramedic navigating political unrest in the Chilean drama *Night Sirens*, a role that has also earned her an Oscar nomination. The award for best first screenplay was claimed by Priya Nair for *Night Sirens*. Actor-writer-director Eli Barker won best first feature for *Summer Static*. France’s *The Silent Province* took best international film, while the environmental investigation *Tide Line* won best documentary. The honors are determined by members of Film Independent, a voting body made up of actors, directors, writers and other industry professionals. Last year’s Spirit Award leader later converted critical buzz into an Oscar win for original screenplay."
"The 1946 holiday classic It’s a Wonderful Life is being developed as a stage musical by producer Jon Thoday, known for backing the boundary-pushing hit Jerry Springer – The Opera. Thoday is partnering with composer and writer Steve Brown, whose previous theatre work includes the award-winning Spend Spend Spend. A representative for the production said the project remains in its early phases, with no casting decisions, venue or premiere date confirmed. Development activity has been underway in London, where workshops have been held to test material, and a small group of performers recently presented songs from the show to invited backers at a private industry event. Thoday said he has wanted to adapt the story for the stage for nearly two decades. The film, directed by Frank Capra and led by James Stewart, was adapted from Philip van Doren Stern’s short story The Greatest Gift. According to the production team, rights to the underlying story were acquired from Stern’s estate before additional agreements were reached to license the film title and elements needed for the musical adaptation."
"A senior executive at insurance brokerage Marsh & McLennan has admitted to wrongdoing amid a widening investigation into alleged bid manipulation in the commercial insurance market, according to New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. The executive, identified by the attorney general’s office as senior vice president Robert Stearns, entered a guilty plea to charges related to a scheme to deceive clients, a case that prosecutors say could result in a prison term ranging from 16 months to four years under state sentencing guidelines. Authorities said Stearns has also agreed to assist investigators and provide testimony in related proceedings as the inquiry continues across the industry.

Marsh, in a brief statement, said it was disappointed by the developments and reiterated that it would continue to work with investigators. The firm added that it intends to address outstanding legal matters and maintain strong compliance practices while continuing to serve clients.

Prosecutors allege that between 2002 and 2004 Stearns directed insurers to submit deliberately uncompetitive quotes in response to client requests for coverage, allowing Marsh to present an appearance of a competitive process while steering business toward a preferred insurer. The attorney general’s office said the alleged conduct enabled the brokerage to influence which carrier ultimately won an account, shielding existing insurers from losing renewals and potentially increasing the brokerage’s compensation.

In one example described by investigators, an internal email allegedly showed Stearns requesting a so-called “B” quote from American International Group that would be priced higher and offer narrower terms, a move prosecutors said was designed to make the incumbent provider, Chubb, appear more attractive.

Marsh continues to face scrutiny from federal regulators as well. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has requested information concerning certain shareholder-related transactions, including dealings involving investors holding at least 5% of the company’s stock, according to people familiar with the matter."
"India’s government has cleared the way for privately owned airlines to begin operating long-distance international services, a policy shift intended to expand capacity and put downward pressure on fares as outbound travel grows. Officials said the new permissions would be rolled out in stages, with some high-demand corridors—particularly flights to Gulf destinations such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates—remaining reserved for state-run carriers for an initial transition period of up to three years. Industry executives said the first beneficiaries are expected to include Jet Airways and Air Sahara, both of which have built sizable domestic networks that could feed passengers into overseas routes.

The decision comes amid surging demand tied to strong economic growth and rising household incomes. Aviation analysts in Delhi estimate passenger numbers have been climbing at close to one-fifth year-on-year, a pace that has strained airports and air-traffic systems. “The biggest bottleneck is on the ground,” said one observer familiar with the sector, noting that several major gateways still lack modern terminals, adequate baggage handling and sufficient runway capacity for heavier international traffic.

The government has reiterated plans to upgrade and, in some cases, bring in private operators to manage airports, though progress has been uneven. Separately, New Delhi has moved to make the sector more attractive to global partners by increasing the cap on foreign investment in domestic airlines to 49% from 40%. Media reports also say India and the United States may reopen talks early next year on expanding bilateral flight rights."
"Tensions between the two prominent heirs of India’s Reliance Group again surfaced this week, this time affecting deliberations at one of the conglomerate’s key subsidiaries. Anil Ambani, vice-chairman of India Petrochemicals Limited (IPCL), did not attend a scheduled meeting of senior executives on Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter. His absence follows his recent attempt to step down from the post, a move that has not been formally accepted by his elder brother Mukesh Ambani, who leads the broader group and also holds ultimate authority at IPCL.

The IPCL board convened in Mumbai to review the company’s performance for the October–December period. Executives said the agenda also included discussion of Anil Ambani’s proposed resignation, with several directors urging him to reconsider. However, the board did not agree to a separate request linked to the dispute: Anil has sought the removal of a fellow director, Anand Jain, whom he has publicly blamed for deepening divisions within the family and influencing decision-making around the brothers.

Anand Jain, regarded in corporate circles as a close associate of Mukesh Ambani, has not commented publicly on the allegations. Company officials declined to discuss internal personnel matters but confirmed that the board had met to approve quarterly disclosures.

In a parallel development, directors at Reliance Energy, another group company headed by Anil Ambani, issued a statement on Wednesday reiterating their support for his leadership. Reliance Group gained control of IPCL in 2002 after purchasing the government’s 26% holding during India’s privatisation programme.

Attention now turns to the flagship Reliance Industries board meeting scheduled for Friday, when quarterly results are due to be considered. With Mukesh serving as chairman and Anil as deputy, the session is expected to bring the brothers into direct contact amid a dispute that has drawn unusually public scrutiny."
"Chancellor Rachel Reeves will present the government’s next Budget to the House of Commons on 12 March, the Treasury has confirmed. The statement said the Budget will be delivered at 12:30 GMT, following Prime Minister’s Questions, in keeping with the usual parliamentary timetable. The Budget is expected to provide an updated assessment of the public finances and the wider economic outlook, alongside decisions on taxation, borrowing and spending plans. With a general election widely anticipated later in the spring, the announcement is likely to sharpen political dividing lines over fiscal policy, public services and living costs. Officials noted that the chancellor will also publish the latest forecasts from the independent budget watchdog, setting out projections for growth, inflation and debt. 

If Parliament is dissolved soon after the Budget, ministers may have limited time to legislate for any tax changes through a Finance Bill. In such circumstances, a pared-back bill would typically be fast-tracked with cross-party agreement to ensure the continued legal collection of duties and other revenues. More complex measures are often deferred, with a fuller Finance Bill returning after polling day, depending on the outcome of the election. 

Business groups and tax advisers called for a focus on stability rather than short-term electoral incentives. “Pre-election Budgets can encourage giveaways that are difficult to sustain,” said one senior partner at a major accountancy firm, urging ministers to prioritise predictability for employers and households."
"Former Labour MP George Galloway has urged those holding humanitarian worker Margaret Hassan to free her, saying he is ready to assist efforts to secure her release. Mrs Hassan, 59, a senior figure with the aid agency Care International in Iraq, was seized in Baghdad on 19 October and has not been seen in public since. Mr Galloway, who was removed from the Labour Party over his outspoken criticism of the Iraq conflict, made the comments in London during a weekend gathering of delegates from his newly launched Respect coalition.

He rejected reports that he intended to address the kidnappers directly through the Arabic-language broadcaster Al Jazeera, insisting that any involvement on his part would be aimed at helping intermediaries rather than seeking personal exposure. “I have stayed away from previous cases,” he told supporters, adding that Mrs Hassan had long been known for opposing both the war and the years of international sanctions that preceded it. He said he would consider travelling to the region or assisting through contacts if it could help prevent harm.

A spokesperson later said Mr Galloway shared acquaintances with Mrs Hassan and had been approached by people concerned about her safety. Since the abduction, Al Jazeera has aired several recordings of Mrs Hassan, the most recent showing her calling for British forces to leave Iraq and urging her organisation to shut its Baghdad office. Care International has since suspended its remaining work in the country."
"IBM said it will invest $120m over the next four years to expand its work with Linux and other open-source tools, aiming to make it simpler for corporate clients to deploy the software across everything from smartphones and tablets to high-end data-center systems. The company said the funding will support engineering, research partnerships and customer outreach designed to improve performance, security and management of Linux-based systems in mixed IT environments. Executives cited rising demand from enterprises looking to standardize their technology stacks while reducing licensing costs and avoiding dependence on a single vendor.

A significant portion of the initiative will focus on collaboration software and device support, IBM said, with new Linux-compatible components planned for its digital workplace offerings. Those products are intended to let employees access business applications, messaging and shared documents regardless of whether they connect through a desktop computer, a thin client or a mobile device. IBM said it plans to enhance tools that help administrators roll out updates and enforce policies across fleets of Linux desktops and handhelds, an area where customers have asked for tighter integration with existing corporate systems.

The company pointed to recent growth in Linux deployments among large organizations, particularly those modernizing internal workflows and moving more applications onto cloud infrastructure. IBM has long backed open-source development, contributing code and staff time to major projects and releasing versions of its software for Linux platforms. Open-source proponents argue that publicly available source code encourages peer review, faster fixes and broader experimentation, benefits IBM said it expects to translate into more reliable products for clients."
"Shareholders dissatisfied with Deutsche Boerse’s pursuit of the London Stock Exchange will be unable to force a vote on senior leadership changes before the company’s next annual gathering in late May, according to Reuters. The Sunday Times reported that activist hedge funds TCI and Atticus were preparing to press for the departure of chairman Rolf Breuer and chief executive Werner Seifert, arguing that the bid strategy risks eroding shareholder returns. Deutsche Boerse told Reuters that any formal request to remove members of its supervisory board must be handled at the annual general meeting scheduled for May 25, limiting investors’ ability to accelerate a decision through an earlier vote.

TCI and Atticus have publicly urged the exchange operator to prioritize returning capital to shareholders instead of pursuing a costly takeover campaign. “We are long-term investors and are experienced in removing management. We are not scared to take this to its conclusion this time,” Atticus partner David Slager was quoted as saying by the Sunday Times. The newspaper also said TCI had begun assembling potential candidates to replace the current leadership.

The funds hold a stake of more than 5% in Deutsche Boerse, a level that in many cases can be used to call an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting. Still, under German corporate rules, the company does not require a shareholder vote to make a takeover offer, leaving opponents focused on governance pressure rather than blocking the bid directly.

Deutsche Boerse is competing with pan-European exchange group Euronext for control of the London Stock Exchange, fueling speculation that the contest could escalate into a higher-priced bidding battle. Any rapid developments may be constrained by regulators, with the UK Office of Fair Trading expected to conclude its review of competition issues tied to the rival proposals in March."
"France’s financial markets authority has lodged formal complaints against conglomerate Vivendi and two senior executives over a recent convertible bond offering, alleging that investor disclosures may have been insufficient and that managers could have traded while in possession of non-public information. The Autorité des marchés financiers said it has opened proceedings involving the company, its chief executive Jean-René Fourtou and chief operating officer Jean-Bernard Lévy. A complaint was also filed concerning Deutsche Bank, which advised on the transaction and handled placement of the bonds with investors, leaving it potentially exposed to sanctions if the regulator’s claims are substantiated.

According to people familiar with the matter cited by wire services, the regulator is examining whether the prospectus failed to clearly present certain risks and strategic contingencies, and whether the executives had access to sensitive details at the time they purchased portions of the offering themselves. Investigators are reported to be focusing on whether the two men knew of expressions of interest in Vivendi’s U.S. assets from investor Marvin Davis during marketing of the bonds.

Vivendi has denied wrongdoing, saying it considers the complaints unfounded and that relevant information was already in the public domain. The company argues that any approach regarding its American holdings had been discussed openly and, in any case, was not actionable after being turned down by the board.

The AMF is also reviewing claims that management was weighing the possibility of exercising rights to acquire British Telecom’s stake in Cegetel around the same period. Vivendi said such a move was merely one option among several and that markets were aware it could be considered.

The case comes as the French regulator continues to take a hard line on disclosure standards. Vivendi has previously faced penalties from the AMF following an investigation into statements made to investors during a period of aggressive acquisitions."
"Postcards created by artists such as Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin were among the first to be snapped up within hours of the opening of the Royal Academy of Arts’ annual Secrets fundraising sale. Buyers do not learn who made a particular work until it has been purchased, when the artist’s name can be found on the reverse. Royal College of Art spokesperson Sue Bradburn said a number of high-profile contributors remained available, including photographer Mario Testino. Each postcard is sold for a fixed price of £35. The event began at 8am on Friday and is due to finish at 6pm on Saturday. Bradburn said the day started with a long line outside the venue, though the crowd had eased later in the morning. She noted that many early purchasers appeared to have arrived with specific targets in mind, spending time carefully comparing the small-format works before choosing. The postcards have been on display for public viewing since 19 November. Contributors this year also include filmmaker Ken Loach, fashion designer Hussein Chalayan and musician Graham Coxon, alongside students and recent graduates from the Royal College of Art and other art schools. Proceeds will support the RCA Fine Art Student Award Fund, which provides bursaries and grants. The sale is in its 11th year."
"The global installed base of personal computers is on course to climb sharply over the next several years, reaching about 1.3 billion systems by 2010, according to a new forecast from market researchers at Forrester Research. The firm said the expansion will be fueled primarily by rising demand in developing economies, with countries such as China, India and Russia accounting for more than a third of all additional machines shipped during the period. China alone is projected to add roughly 178 million PCs by 2010, the report estimated, as falling prices and broader internet access bring first-time buyers into the market. Forrester said domestic manufacturers are likely to gain the upper hand in these regions by offering lower-cost models and configurations tailored to local languages, software needs and purchasing power. The outlook arrives days after IBM, long associated with the early PC industry, agreed to sell its personal computer business to Lenovo, China’s largest computer maker, in a transaction valued at $1.75bn (£900m). The combined company is expected to rank as the world’s third-largest PC supplier. “Competitive advantage in emerging markets will increasingly come from local companies that can align design, pricing and applications with regional conditions,” said Simon Yates, a senior Forrester analyst. The study puts the current worldwide PC population at about 575 million units, while predicting more mature markets in the United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific will collectively add around 150 million PCs by 2010. India is forecast to bring in about 80 million new users, with Indonesia adding about 40 million."
"Hayao Miyazaki’s newest animated feature, “Howl’s Moving Castle,” will roll out in about 50 markets worldwide, according to its distributor. The film opened strongly in Japan, where it set a new early box-office benchmark by earning roughly 1.5 billion yen in its first weekend. Miyazaki, who won this year’s Academy Award for “Spirited Away,” has drawn renewed international attention to Japanese animation, and the studio expects that momentum to carry into overseas theaters. Adapted from a fantasy novel by British writer Diana Wynne Jones, the story follows a young woman cursed by a witch and transformed into an elderly figure, prompting her to seek refuge in a wandering castle owned by the mysterious wizard Howl as she searches for a way to reverse the spell. A Toho representative said the picture has attracted notable interest from audiences and media abroad. The international release is scheduled to begin with South Korea in late December, followed by France in mid-January."
"Madagascar has finalized the transition from the Malagasy franc to the ariary, completing a multi-year overhaul of its monetary system. Beginning Monday, retailers, employers and government agencies must list prices, salaries and official fees exclusively in the new unit, which was quoted at about 1,890 to the US dollar in early trading. The franc has ceased to be legal tender, though the central bank said it can still be exchanged at commercial banks for several years to ease the changeover for households and businesses. Officials said the shift, launched in phases in 2003, is meant to strengthen monetary credibility after a period of sharp depreciation and to curb losses linked to fake notes that had circulated widely. A senior central bank representative described the move as a statement of national autonomy, noting that the name “ariary” revives a traditional term used for money on the island before colonial administration."
"The European Parliament has voted down draft legislation that would have expanded the scope for patenting computer-implemented inventions, sending the proposal back to EU institutions for further review. Lawmakers supported a motion to reject the text outright, meaning the measure cannot proceed in its current form and would need to be reintroduced after new consultations if it is to return to the legislative agenda. Supporters of the plan, including several large technology firms and industry groups, argued that clearer patent rules are necessary to encourage investment in research and development and to give European companies confidence that novel software-driven products can be protected from imitation. A spokesperson for a Brussels-based trade association said innovators would be more likely to develop new tools and services if the legal framework offered predictable safeguards for intellectual property. Backers also contended that the EU approach sought to draw boundaries that would prevent the broadest kinds of claims seen elsewhere, where patents may cover certain methods of doing business as well as code-based solutions. Critics, however, warned that the proposal risked granting overly strong rights for ideas implemented in software, potentially enabling litigation-heavy strategies and making it harder for smaller developers to compete. Opponents also said the measure could create legal uncertainty for collaborative development models, including open-source projects, by increasing the likelihood of infringement disputes. The bill had faced repeated setbacks in recent months, including delays linked to objections from some national delegations and calls from parliamentary committees to revise key provisions. Under EU procedures, any future version would still require approval from both the Parliament and a qualified majority of member states before it could become law."
"Plans by a major Hollywood studio to depict Dominica’s indigenous Carib community as cannibals in an upcoming instalment of a blockbuster pirate franchise have drawn sharp criticism from the group’s leadership. Carib Chief Marcus Laurent said meetings with representatives of the production team indicated that the screenplay contains “repeated references to cannibalism” that, he was told, are central to the plot and unlikely to be altered. Dominica’s government has confirmed that the film-makers are scouting locations on the island and have expressed interest in shooting several sequences there, citing the island’s rainforest landscape and coastline.

The Caribs, also known as the Kalinago, have long rejected accounts that portray their ancestors as cannibals, arguing the label was used by European colonisers to justify conquest and dispossession. “We resisted invasion, and that resistance was rewritten as barbarity,” Mr Laurent said. “We cannot allow old stereotypes to be recycled for entertainment.”

Filming is expected to begin later this spring, and local casting calls have already attracted large numbers of applicants seeking work as extras, according to officials involved in the preparations. Around 3,000 Kalinago people live in Dominica, which has a population of roughly 70,000, and community representatives say they worry the portrayal could affect how indigenous people are viewed by tourists and the wider public.

Mr Laurent said he has contacted indigenous organisations in the Caribbean and beyond to support an appeal for revisions. He acknowledged, however, that opinion within the community is divided, with some residents favouring the economic boost the production could bring. The studio did not respond to requests for comment."
"Fox has begun developing a U.S. drama serial inspired by the BBC soap EastEnders, according to industry reports. Trade publication The Hollywood Reporter said the network has commissioned early scripts and enlisted EastEnders head writer Tony Jordan alongside entertainment entrepreneur Simon Fuller to help shape the adaptation. The proposed series would shift the setting to Chicago, focusing on the intertwined lives of working-class residents in a tight-knit neighborhood. The move comes after the original British program was dropped by BBC America last year following weak audience figures. Previous attempts to translate U.K. hits for American viewers have produced mixed results; NBC’s remake of the BBC comedy Coupling, for instance, was pulled from its prime-time schedule after struggling in the ratings. Meanwhile, EastEnders has faced increased competition in the U.K., with recent viewing figures trailing ITV’s Emmerdale. Executives have shown renewed interest in prime-time soaps in the U.S. after the breakout performance of ABC’s Desperate Housewives, which blended drama with a satirical edge."
"Chinese authorities have taken three senior managers from dairy producer Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group into custody amid allegations of financial misconduct, according to state media and company disclosures. Yili said its board chairman, chief financial officer and the executive responsible for securities affairs are cooperating with investigators, and the firm has convened a special board session to address governance issues and business continuity. A company representative declined to detail the reasons for the detentions, but Xinhua cited people familiar with the inquiry as saying it centers on suspected misappropriation of corporate funds.  

The detentions come after weeks of market chatter about Yili’s accounting practices and past financing decisions. Several domestic outlets have reported that investigators are reviewing transactions linked to a management-led deal carried out in 2003, including claims that hundreds of millions of yuan were diverted for purposes unrelated to core operations. Yili has not confirmed the amount under review.  

Trading in Yili’s shares was halted after the stock posted a sharp decline earlier in the week, heightening investor unease. The company is one of the largest players in China’s dairy industry, competing with Mengniu Dairy and Bright Dairy in a market that has expanded rapidly as consumer demand for packaged milk has increased. Analysts said the case could prompt closer scrutiny of corporate controls across the sector, particularly among firms that relied on aggressive financing during periods of fast growth."
"Bath have brought back former scrum-half Andy Williams on a short-term agreement after securing his release from the Neath-Swansea Ospreys. The Wales international, whose deal with the Welsh region was set to run out in June, will remain with the Premiership club until the close of the current campaign. Bath moved quickly to add experience at scrum-half with Martyn Wood sidelined by injury and not expected to return until February, leaving Nick Walshe short of proven cover. Williams said he was keen to seize the chance to rejoin a club he knows well. Capped by Wales against Romania in 2003, he is expected to be considered for selection for Monday’s league fixture away to Sale Sharks. Williams has recently found opportunities limited at the Ospreys, slipping behind New Zealander Jason Spice and with younger options Richie Rees and Rhodri Wells pushing for more game time. Bath director of rugby Jack Rowell said Williams’ recent Heineken Cup and Celtic League involvement made him an ideal fit for the run-in."
"A new industry initiative is aiming to help smaller record labels place more of their catalogues on major digital platforms, as music consumption continues to shift toward online purchases. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) said its research suggests independent releases remain under-represented on many download services, despite strong sales in traditional formats. “Independent music has long performed well in shops, and we want to see it compete on equal terms in digital retail,” said BPI chief executive Peter Jamieson. Digital single sales have now surpassed physical single purchases in the UK, widening the commercial stakes for labels without large marketing budgets. The BPI said it is in talks with leading providers, including iTunes and Napster, encouraging them to improve visibility for independent artists through featured placements and tailored recommendations. The organisation also noted that download purchases are expected to count toward the UK singles chart later this year, a change it described as likely to influence promotion strategies. As part of the programme, the BPI will host workshops for independent companies on distribution, rights management and online marketing. Similar chart rules have already been adopted in the United States."
"Chart-leading British pop-rock trio Neon Avenue have confirmed they will pause group activities later this year, easing speculation that the band was preparing to split. In a statement released by their label, Horizon Records, the company said lead singer and guitarist Ryan Cole intends to devote the coming months to writing and touring with his side project, the heavier outfit Northbound. The label added that Neon Avenue members Cole, drummer Liam Hart and bassist Joel Mercer remain committed to returning to the studio “at a later stage”, though no timetable was announced.

Neon Avenue have been a regular fixture on the singles chart since breaking through in 2019, notching seven top-five releases, including three that reached number one. Their best-known tracks include First Period, Satellite Summer, Runaway Vows, Don’t Say Maybe and The Missing Name. The group’s self-titled debut album entered the top 10 on release, and its follow-up, All The Lights On, performed similarly the next year, helping to cement their reputation for bright hooks set against guitar-driven arrangements.

The band collected best pop act at last year’s National Music Awards and were nominated in the British group category. Most recently, they scored another chart-topper with their song Sky Rescue, recorded for the promotional campaign of a new big-screen action remake.

Industry observers have noted the group’s appeal among fans looking for radio-friendly pop that still foregrounds live instruments and songwriting credits. Recent reports had suggested Cole was considering stepping away to focus on Northbound, which is expected to announce tour dates shortly."
"Newcastle manager Graeme Souness said he never sensed his side were on the verge of a shock exit as they progressed to the Uefa Cup last 16 after a 2-1 home win over Heerenveen sealed a 4-2 aggregate success. United struck quickly, benefiting from an early own goal before Alan Shearer doubled the advantage with a crisp finish, but the visitors responded after the interval to ensure a tense closing spell. “The first-leg result put us in a strong position,” Souness said. “When you score early it can make players think it’s already settled, and their goal reminded us we still had work to do.”

Shearer’s effort kept him closing in on Jackie Milburn’s long-standing club tally of 200 goals, leaving the striker a dozen short of the landmark. Souness played down suggestions the chase might influence Shearer’s plans, with the captain having indicated he expects to retire at the end of the campaign. “Records are nice, but I don’t think they decide a career,” he said. “If he’s enjoying it and feeling fit, that matters more.”

Souness also singled out winger Laurent Robert for praise, citing his delivery and willingness to drive at defenders as key to Newcastle’s most dangerous passages. “That’s the level we need from him regularly,” the manager added."
"French household consumption edged up 1.4% in February, offering a modest boost to hopes of steadier economic momentum, according to data released on Tuesday by the national statistics office. The agency said spending was 3.5% higher than a year earlier, with stronger purchases of home appliances and other durable goods accounting for much of the monthly gain. Consumer prices, meanwhile, slipped 0.4% from January but were 1.7% above their level a year ago, pointing to easing short-term inflation pressures even as annual price growth remained firm. Not all sectors shared in the improvement: registrations of new cars declined 2.5% on the month after a small drop in January, though the market still posted a 6.1% increase compared with February last year. Economists said resilient household demand has been one of the main pillars of recent activity, but cautioned that the outlook remains exposed to external shocks. “Consumption can keep the economy afloat, but the pace is vulnerable to higher borrowing costs and renewed swings in energy prices,” said a Paris-based analyst. In neighboring Italy, a separate survey showed consumer sentiment rising to 104.1 from 103.0, its best reading since late autumn, despite softer expectations for the near term."
"A survey of secondary school pupils has found widespread gaps in political awareness among teenagers, with many saying they do not see learning about parties and elections as a priority. In interviews conducted with 120 students aged 14 to 16 for an education report, fewer than one in three correctly identified which party currently leads the government and which forms the main opposition, while a similar proportion were unsure where the third-largest party sits. Most respondents could name the prime minister, but recognition of other senior figures was markedly lower, with fewer than two in 10 able to identify the opposition leader and only around one in 10 recognising the leader of a smaller national party. Several pupils also held mistaken views about which party is in office. The research also explored national identity, finding that the Union flag, traditional meals and familiar sporting events were the most commonly cited markers of Britishness. Many students described themselves primarily by their home nation, and references to a European identity were rare."
"The competitive careers of Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou appear finished, according to the head of the national body that recently dropped domestic disciplinary findings over their alleged failure to attend a doping control. Addressing lawmakers in Athens, Greek Athletics Federation president Vassilli Sevastis said he does not expect either athlete to return to top-level racing, arguing that reputational harm has already undermined their prospects for sponsorship and participation. International officials are now weighing how to respond to the federation’s decision, while the two athletes also face proceedings in Greece’s criminal courts. Prosecutors have filed separate allegations linked to the missed test and claims that a reported motorcycle incident was staged to explain their absence. Sevastis told parliament that material provided by the International Olympic Committee and the sport’s global governing body did not, in his view, meet the threshold required for a guilty verdict under the federation’s procedures. He said the panel was asked to deliver a decisive outcome without being given documentation strong enough to support sanctions. Although the ruling leaves Kenteris and Thanou eligible to enter competitions pending any appeal, Sevastis maintained that further arbitration—even if it overturns the decision—would not restore their standing."
"The first U.S. guilty pleas tied to large-scale copyright violations on a peer-to-peer file-sharing system have been entered, federal prosecutors said. Authorities identified the defendants as William Trowbridge of New York and Michael Chicoine of Texas, who admitted to participating in an online scheme that distributed copyrighted music, films and software without permission. The men face potential sentences of up to five years in prison and fines that can reach $250,000, according to the Department of Justice.

In court filings and a statement, prosecutors said the two helped run key “hub” servers used to coordinate a wider sharing community operating on the Direct Connect network, a platform that enables users to exchange files by connecting through centralized directories. Investigators allege the group, described by officials as an organized piracy ring, required members to make substantial collections available to others—ranging from small libraries to massive archives measured in gigabytes—in order to gain access.

Federal agents said they were able to obtain numerous copyrighted works directly from the network as part of the investigation, including feature films, commercial software, video games and music tracks, which officials characterized as evidence of a deliberate operation rather than casual sharing. The case grew out of a series of enforcement actions carried out in August, when the FBI executed search warrants at multiple locations linked to suspected online piracy activity.

The raids were part of an initiative known as Operation Digital Gridlock, aimed at dismantling networks accused of trafficking in pirated digital content. Prosecutors said both men pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement, and also acknowledged conduct intended to provide commercial benefit. Sentencing is scheduled for 29 April."
"Climate change risks accelerating beyond manageable limits within the next few decades, Scotland’s environmental regulator has told MSPs as part of a parliamentary inquiry into the country’s readiness for a warmer, more volatile climate. Giving evidence to Holyrood’s environment committee, officials from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency said emissions from transport and energy continue to rise, and warned that existing policies may not cut greenhouse gases quickly enough. Witnesses argued that Scotland will likely need a mix of measures, including rapid expansion of renewable generation and continued use of low‑carbon baseload power, while broader efforts to curb demand are scaled up. 

Several contributors to the session said large onshore wind developments could become more common, bringing visible changes to rural landscapes, while investment in grid upgrades and storage would be required to maintain reliability. Others urged ministers to focus on reducing aviation within the UK and shifting more journeys onto electrified rail services, alongside cleaner buses and support for active travel. 

The committee also heard fresh analysis from marine researchers monitoring the Atlantic approaches to Scotland, who reported signs that severe weather could become more frequent and more damaging. Scientists involved in a multi‑institution study have been examining wave patterns and storm surges using satellite observations and buoy data collected over recent years, with a focus on the waters off the west coast and around the Hebrides. They told MSPs the findings align with projections of higher seas and stronger storms, increasing risks to coastal communities, infrastructure and fisheries."
"Jennifer Lopez and her husband, singer Marc Anthony, are expected to share the stage for a joint performance at this month’s Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, organisers have confirmed. The couple, who married in 2004, will appear together during the 13 February broadcast in a duet that is already drawing attention as one of the night’s headline moments. Anthony, a Grammy winner with a long track record in Latin music, arrives at this year’s ceremony with multiple nominations, including recognition in Latin pop and tropical categories.

The show will also feature a special all-star version of The Beatles’ “Across the Universe,” performed by Bono, Stevie Wonder, Norah Jones and Brian Wilson, as part of a fundraising effort for victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami. A studio version of the track, which also includes contributions from Alicia Keys, Velvet Revolver and Tim McGraw, will be made available for purchase online, with proceeds directed toward relief initiatives. Fans will be able to buy the song through iTunes and access a companion video through CBS’s website.

Beyond the tribute, the telecast is set to include appearances by U2, Green Day, Keys and rapper Kanye West, who leads this year’s nominations with 10. West is slated to perform with John Legend, Mavis Staples and the Blind Boys of Alabama. The programme will also honour the late Ray Charles, who has several posthumous nominations, with a tribute segment featuring artists including Bonnie Raitt and Billy Preston, alongside a separate celebration of southern rock bringing together McGraw, Gretchen Wilson and members of Lynyrd Skynyrd."
"Second seed Joachim Johansson claimed the Australian Hardcourt Championships in Adelaide on Sunday, defeating American Taylor Dent 7-5 6-3 to secure the second title of his professional career. The Swede was tested early as Dent fought off several chances to drop serve, saving three break points in a tense fifth game that kept the opening set on a knife edge. Johansson eventually found the decisive opening late in the set with an aggressive return that swung momentum, then tightened his baseline play to pull clear in the second. The victory follows his breakthrough tournament win in Memphis in 2004, a result that helped propel him from outside the top 100 into the upper tier of the rankings. Dent, despite the loss, said Johansson’s power game made him a serious threat for the Australian Open, which begins on 17 January, pointing in particular to his serving accuracy. Johansson said he was encouraged by his form but insisted he needed further improvements in Melbourne."
"Elena Dementieva defeated defending champion Venus Williams 6-3 6-2 on Sunday to capture the Champions Challenge exhibition title in Hong Kong. The sixth-ranked Russian took control early at Victoria Park, converting three breaks of serve in the opening set and limiting Williams’ opportunities on return. Williams briefly threatened a comeback by fighting off three match points, but Dementieva closed out the contest with steady baseline play and consistent serving. “It’s a positive way to begin the season, even if it’s not part of the regular tour,” Dementieva said, adding that the win would boost her confidence heading into the year’s major tournaments. Williams, 24, said she was frustrated by her level, citing a high number of unforced errors at key moments. Prior to the final, tournament officials held a charity auction of player racquets, raising about £115,000 for tsunami relief efforts."
"The Manhattan recording complex where John Lennon worked on some of his last sessions is set to shut its doors in the coming weeks, marking the end of an era for one of New York’s best-known studios. The Hit Factory, a fixture of the city’s music scene for decades, built its reputation by hosting major acts across pop, rock and hip-hop, but operators say changing technology and shifting client demand have made the large facility increasingly difficult to sustain. The company plans to move operations to a smaller location in Miami, reflecting an industry-wide drift toward compact rooms and home-based production.

Lennon is among the studio’s most closely associated artists, having recorded material there for his comeback album “Double Fantasy” in the late 1970s. Founded in 1968 by songwriter and producer Jerry Ragovoy, the business later changed hands and expanded under producer Edward Germano into a multi-room complex offering recording, mixing and mastering services under one roof. Early sessions included work by Stevie Wonder, and the studio’s credits grew to encompass landmark projects such as Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A.,” the Rolling Stones’ “Emotional Rescue,” and Paul Simon’s “Graceland.” Over the years, artists ranging from Madonna and David Bowie to Jay-Z and Beyoncé booked time at the facility. In the mid-1990s, the studio reached a high-water mark when recordings completed there were linked to dozens of Grammy nominations in a single year, including music from “The Bodyguard” soundtrack."
"EuroDisney, the Paris-area theme park operator, announced plans on Tuesday to raise about 255 million euros through a new share issue as it seeks to avert a cash crisis and complete a broader overhaul of its balance sheet. The offering forms the final stage of a debt restructuring aimed at addressing roughly 2.4 billion euros in liabilities accumulated since the resort opened in the early 1990s. Management said recent operating trends have improved, citing firmer attendance and higher ticket revenue, but market watchers remain cautious about whether the resort can sustain profitability once the refinancing measures are in place. The complex is still regarded as Europe’s biggest single tourist draw, with annual visitor numbers around 12 million, and has been expanding its entertainment lineup with a recently launched studio-themed park next to the main site. Shares in the company fell sharply in Paris trading following the announcement, as investors reacted to the dilution implied by the low offer price. The new stock will be taken up by the group’s two leading investors, including the US-based Disney parent and a Middle Eastern partner, according to the company."
"A low-budget drama featuring actor Mark Ruffalo as a recently released sex offender took the festival’s top prize at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on Saturday, prompting debate over the decision. The film, titled *Second Chances*, received the Caledonia Grand Award, an honour named for pioneering Scottish filmmaker John Grierson. Directed by first-time feature director Lena Whitaker, the story follows a man attempting to re-enter society after a long prison sentence, while facing public hostility and strict supervision. In a statement, the jury said the film confronted a difficult subject with restraint and careful attention to the impact on victims and the wider community. Past recipients of the award include several titles that later found wider acclaim on the international circuit.

The festival also recognised emerging home-grown talent, presenting its UK New Voices prize to writer-director Saira Mahmood for her debut *Harbour Street*, set in Newcastle and centred on a young mother drawn into an escalating dispute with her immigrant neighbours. Separate honours from the International Critics’ Panel went to *Glass Steps*, a French-Belgian feature about disability and independence, while the festival’s first-film trophy was awarded to Canadian filmmaker Eli Navarro for the autobiographical collage *Static Days*.

The event concluded with a gala screening of the ensemble comedy *The Existentialists*, starring Paul Rudd and Frances McDormand, directed by indie veteran Martin Keene. This year’s line-up also included an early European showing of the latest animation from Studio Lumi and the UK premiere of the urban drama *Southside Boys*."
